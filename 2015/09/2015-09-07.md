## Mobile Web App

### Advantages

* Frequent update(requirements, operations, etc.)
* Connectivity(hyper links)
* Cross-platform, Cross-device
* Rapid development
* Standardization

### Challenges

* Compatibility(screen size, engines)
* Weak connection
* Performance(animations, jaggy experience)

### Compatibility

* 4.0+
* CSS resolution = Real resolution/Device pixel ratio
    * Common resolution: 320px and 360px

### Networking

* RCC -> DNS lookup(1RTT) -> TCP handshake(1RTT) -> TLS handshake(1-2RTT) -> HTTP(1-nRTT)
* Delay is the bottleneck
* RCC: negotiation with the ISP for establishing channels
* 3-way handshake and slow start is the key to TCP optimization
    * For short-lived connections requesting small files, slow start is the bottleneck

### Optimization

* Reuse connections, reduce number of requests, first-screen resources shoule be < 14KB(based on `initcwnd`, MTU, and average response header size)
* `keep-alive` ~ 120s. Google has Fast Open in Chrome.
* Compression(images, HTML & JS & CSS uglify, Gzip)
* Async(lazy load non-first-screen resources including CSS & JS)
* Parallel(non-blocking loading, balance the resource package)
* Advance(caching, pre-connection, pre-loading, offline, built-in assets, local storage)

#### Offline

* AppCache
    * One fails, discard all.
    * No tuning for different type of connections(2/3G, WiFi)
    * No reuse if the loading is interrupted by page jump/close
* Use Native container
    * `NSURLCache` on iOS, `WebViewClient.shouldInterceptRequest` on Android for proxy cache
    * Read from the App assets(use a modified script loader that doesn't request from HTTP but request from Device API, or use the Native App to intercept HTTP requests(needs Android 4.0+))
    * Incremental update
    * Discard the cache if necessary by push from server
    * Update validation by timestamp/md5
* Note same-origin policy
* SPDY/HTTP2
    * Use native Device API layer

#### Rendering

* Scrolling and animations(FPS < 30)
* Software rendering: recursive, render by layers(bottom to the top), store bitmaps into the frame buffer and draw it
* Hardware rendering: use compositor to draw `GraphicsLayer` recursivly(calculate bitmap -> rasterization to texture -> GPU combines the texture -> draw)
* Relayout, repaint, recomposite. Repaint is the key to rendering optimization.
* Seperate static and dynamic content, control the calculations
* Use 3D CSS(e.g. `transform: translate3d(0,0,0)`, `transform: perspective(0)` and opacity) to trigger hardware acceleration
* Note that WebView UI thread can crash the Native application
