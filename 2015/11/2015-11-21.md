## JS

### Calendar

Finally have some time to write a new calendar for this diary. Spend some time figure out the algorithm, and it is suprisingly easy...

```javascript
function getTableForMonth(year, month) {
  var firstDayInMonth = new Date(year, month, 1)
  var lastDayInMonth = new Date(year, month + 1, 0);
  var currentDate = firstDayInMonth, currentWeekDay = 0;
  var table = [[]], currentRow = 0;
  while (currentDate.getDay() !== 0) {
    currentDate.setDate(currentDate.getDate() - 1);
  }

  while (currentDate <= lastDayInMonth) {
    table[currentRow].push(new Date(currentDate));
    currentWeekDay = (currentWeekDay + 1) % 7;
    currentDate.setDate(currentDate.getDate() + 1);
    if (currentDate.getDay() === 0) {
      table.push([]);
      currentRow += 1;
    }
  }

  if (currentDate.getDate() !== 6) {
    while (currentDate.getDay() !== 0) {
      table[currentRow].push(new Date(currentDate));
      currentDate.setDate(currentDate.getDate() + 1);
    }
  }

  return table;
}
```

Will write a React component with it. Seems isomorphic JS is suitable for this project(I really hate the blank that Pikaday gives me when the page is just loaded).
