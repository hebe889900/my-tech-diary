## ES6

### [ES6 In Depth: Modules](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/08/es6-in-depth-modules/)

#### Modules

* ES6 modules are in *strict mode* automatically, even if you don't write `"use strict"`
* You can `import` and `export` modules
* The dependency tree will be traversed with DFS, executed scripts will be skipped to avoid cycles
* They need to be static. They have to be at the top-level scope, and can't be conditional. Their names have to be determined in the source code.
* You can't monkey-patch a module. They are frozen.

#### Export

* You need to export **explicitly**.
* The syntax is simple: put `export` before things you want to export.

  ```javascript
  export function f() {...}
  export class A {...}
  export var a = ...
  ```
* You can also export things all at once

  ```javascript
  export {a, b};
  var a = ..., b = ...
  ```
* You can rename your exports

  ```
  export {a as b, c as d};
  ```
* You can wrap a bunch of things up as the default for your whole module

  ```javascript
  export {anInterface as default};
  // or
  export default {
    a: b,
    c: d
  }
  ```
* Export from other modules

  ```javascript
  export {a, b} from "script.js"
  export * from "script.js"
  ```
  Note that this won't add those forwarded things into your scope.

#### Import

* `import {a, b, c} from "script.js"`
* `import {d as e, f as g} from "script.js"`
* `import defaultExport from "script.js"` (i.e. `var defaultExport = require("script.js")`)(this is what that module exports as default, not everything it exports)
* `import * from "script.js"`

#### What does the engine do

1. Parse your code, find all `import`s(yes, they will try to load it as early as possible)
2. Load all imported modules(not standardized)
3. Link all bindings(where importing things that are not exported will throw errors)
4. Run every loaded module(this time when it reaches an `import`, nothing will happen because it has preloaded everything)

As you can see, modules are loaded eagerly, and there are no error recovery. It's better to bundle the code in the production environment though.

## HTML Content Models

### Types

* **Flow**: Most contents are flow contents, exceptions include some metadata content like `<style>` without `scope`, but that's trivial. They can **contain text or embedded content**.
* **Heading**: `<h*>`(and the deprecated `<hgroup>`). Note `<header>` is not heading content. None is phrasing content.
* **Sectioning**: `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`. Create a section that defines the scope of  `<header>` elements, `<footer>` elements, and heading content. None is phrasing content.
* **Phrasing**: content that you normally consider "inlined". Runs of phrasing content make up paragraphs
* **Embedded**: inserts content from another mark-up language or namespace e.g. `<img>`, `<iframe>`, `<audio>`, `<video>`, `<embed>`, `<object>`, `<svg>`. All are phrasing contents too.
* **Interactive**: e.g. `<audio>`, `<video>`, `<select>`, `<button>`. Some are phrasing content.
* **Metadata** e.g. `<link>`, `<meta>`, `<noscript>`, `<script>`, `<style>`, `<title>`. Some are phrasing content.
