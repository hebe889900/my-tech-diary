## [ES6 In Depth: Classes](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/07/es6-in-depth-classes/)

### The new object shorthand

```javascript
var obj = {
  // Node need for key: value pair, just declare values!

  // No need for the `function` keyword
  method(args) { ... },

  // Generators only need an extra `*`
  *genMethod(args) { ... },

  // Accessors only need an extra `get`/`set`
  // Note: they can't be generators though, and the getter can't have arguments
  get propName() { ... },

  // Note: the setter installed in this way can only have one argument
  set propName(arg) { ... },

  // Use a `[]` for dynamically computed names!!
  // This can be a method, a generator or an accessor!
  [dynamicallyComputeName()] (args) { ... }
};
```

### Classes

* `class`, `constructor` and `static` syntax sugar.
* In the old way
  * Use `Object.defineProperty` to define accessors
  * The constructor function is the class
  * "static" methods are attached to the constructor function: `Class.staticMethod = ...`
  * "static" variables are defined with `Object.defineProperty(Class, "staticMember", {...})`
  * "instance" methods are attached to the prototype: `Class.prototype.instanceMethod = ...`
  * "instance" variables are defined with `Object.defineProperty(Class.prototype, "instanceMember", {...})`, and accessed via `this`
* In the `class` way, you
  * Define accessors in the class definition directly
  * Use `constructor` keyword int he class definition to define constructors
  * Declare "static" methods with `static` in the class definition: `static staticMethod(...) {...}`
  * Declare "static" variables with `static` accessors in the class definition: `static get staticMember() {...}` and `static set staticMmeber(arg) {...}`
  * Declare "instance" methods in the class definition without `static`: `instanceMethod(...) {...}`
  * Declare "instance" variables with accessors without `static` in the class definition: `get instanceMember() {...}` and `set instanceMmeber(arg) {...}`

```javascript
class Circle {
    constructor(radius) {
        this.radius = radius;  // "instance" variable
        Circle.circlesMade++;  // "static" variable
    };

    // static accessors for Circle.circlesMade
    // which should have been attached to the class directly
    // and need that `Object.defineProperty` syntax
    static get circlesMade() {
        return !this._count ? 0 : this._count;
    };
    static set circlesMade(val) {
        this._count = val;
    };

    // "instance methods", which should have been on prototypes
    draw(canvas) {
        // Canvas drawing code
    };
    area() {
        return Math.pow(this.radius, 2) * Math.PI;
    };

    // instance accessors, which should have been on prototypes
    // and need that `Object.defineProperty`
    get radius() {
        return this._radius;
    };
    set radius(radius) {
        if (!Number.isInteger(radius))
            throw new Error("Circle radius must be an integer.");
        this._radius = radius;
    };
}
```

### Gotcha & Tips

* Semicolons are optional(they are there just to make the class look more like what you see in C++...and in Java that's optional too)
* The constructor is optional. It's default is `constructor() {}` -- an empty function
* Constructors have to be normal functions. They can't be generators
* If a computed property name happens to be `constructor`, it won't be a real constructor(so there won't be any overriding). That would just be a normal property named `constructor`.
* The bindings in the classes work like named anonymous functions, so even if you set `Class = somethingElse` in the enclosing scope, it won't misbehave.
* There are class expressions. And yes, they are pretty much like the function expressions(so you can pass them around as arguments without creating variables in the scope).
* Methods installed in the class syntax are **configurable, but not enumerable**.
* `const` and installable variables are coming. Currently you can only define variables with accessors or attach them in methods.

### Implementations

* Firefox Nightly, Chrome and Edge have implemented it, but only FFN enables it by default.
* Safari haven't implemented yet(well, we have been saying that Safari will be the new IE :().
