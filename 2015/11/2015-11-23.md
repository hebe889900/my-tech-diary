## Security

I left the static server on my laptop open today and when I came back from work, I noticed some unusual logs like:

```
22:11:45 [404]: /announce.php?info_hash=J%8C%A5%D5%93i%E3%1F%E5%F6%A8%F4%A5%D1%0Dka%8Ch%00&peer_id=%2DSD0100%2D%7FZ%A9%B9%02%91O4%
80%EC%2F%A5&ip=192.168.1.111&port=11807&uploaded=2310991277&downloaded=2310991277&left=0&numwant=200&key=20033&compact=1
```

I turned it off without digging deeper(e.g. checkout the HTTP header of the next request). Looks like some kind of DNS spoofing(GFW)? But my laptop is not on the public network...
