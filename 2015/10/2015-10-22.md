## nginx

When you are receiving 502 when visiting HTTPS sites, maybe you are not getting the `proxy_pass` right. You have to explicitly tell nginx that URLs like `https://example.com:443` needed to be forwarded to the 443 port of the upstream servers.

Conf not working(taken from [here](https://mattgadient.com/2013/12/28/nginx-502-bad-gateway-errors-when-set-as-a-proxy-over-ssl-https/)):

```
upstream backend {
     server 123.45.67.89;
     server 12.34.56.789 backup;
}
server {
     listen 443;
     server_name example.com;
     location / {
         proxy_pass https://backend;
     }
}
```

Conf working:

```
upstream backend-ssl {
     server 123.45.67.89:443;
     server 12.34.56.789:443 backup;
}
server {
     listen 443;
     server_name example.com;
     location / {
         proxy_pass https://backend-ssl;
     }
}
```
