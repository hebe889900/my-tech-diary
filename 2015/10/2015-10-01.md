## PostCSS

Attempted to update the PostCSS (to 5.x) used in my diary generator and discovered that the latest versions of cssnext and cssnano are still not compatible with PostCSS 5.0...

## Node

Switched from nodist to nvm-windows and installed Node 4.1.0 on my own laptop. The HTTPS npmjs.org registry is still blocked, so I had to use the taobao mirror instead.

I expected a speedup of my generators after I upgraded my Node.js (because of the improvements on `require` and all) but it didn't show up. Maybe only a SSD can help me with that :(.

## PHP

I'm astonished to discover that for quite a long time, the Zend engine [compiled the script to opcode EVERY SINGLE TIME a reqeust comes in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP#Implementations)...Geez!

And uh...It seems that the crappy code base of Zend is making it [really hard to get the code JITted](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9122195). No wonder Facebook started HHVM...
