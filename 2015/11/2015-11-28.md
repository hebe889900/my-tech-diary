### [A tour of V8: Garbage Collection](http://jayconrod.com/posts/55/a-tour-of-v8-garbage-collection)

### Problem: distinguish pointers and data

#### Needs

* **Follow** ponters to discover live objects
* **Rewrite** pointers without disturbing plain old data


#### Apporaches

* **Conservative**
  * Doesn't need support from the compiler
  * Treat **all aligned words as pointers**, even though they might be data
  * **Problem**
    * **Can't just move objects around** -> possible memory leak: A small data object could keep many objects alive
    * **No much benefit from compaction**
  * Example: [Boehm garbage collector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boehm_garbage_collector) for C/C++
* **Compiler hints**
  * For statically-typed language
  * The compiler knows the **offsets of pointers within each class**, so if we know the class of an object, we can find all of its pointers
  * Doesn't work well with dynamic languages
* **Tagged pointers**
  * Reserve **a bit(tag) at the end of each word** to indicate if it's pointer or data
  * Only needs limited compiler support, simple, efficient
  * V8, OCaml

#### SMI

* SMI: -2^30 ~ 2^30-1(2^31 numbers), the lowest bit 0 indicates that it is an small integer(pointers have 1)
* Objects are always at least 4-byte aligned, and pointers can't point to the middle of an object in JS
* Most objects are just **a list of tagged words**
* GC and scan the words quickly, skipping integers and following pointers
* Objects like strings only have data, so they don't have to be tagged
