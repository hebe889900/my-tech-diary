* Use cookies to implement sticky sessions. It's not necessary but it keep the user from bounding when they fallback to polling
* Use request for failover checking
* The app is a server broadcasting mesages to all clients. For scalability, use redis(with pub/sub) to store the client list instead of keeping it in the Node process memory
  * RabbitMQ and ZeroMQ can do the job too,but redis is just simple and fast

* For peer support: **created a wiki** an invited engineers to express their questions, concerns, doubts, or anything else about Node.js
* Initial dependencies: express, cluster, request, async. Uses MongoDB for its ease of use and its existing infrastructure at eBay
* Use shell scripts and CI for deployment
* Use their logging API for monitoring
  * Code-level logging: errors, exceptions, DB queries, HTTP service calls, transaction metadata, etc.
  * Machine-level logging: heartbeat data about CPU/memory/other OS statistics
    * Extended `cluster` module for this
  * Load-balancer-level logging: health checking
