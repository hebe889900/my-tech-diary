## JS/V8

### [Optimization killers](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/wiki/Optimization-killers)

* Inner functions that contain pattern for bailout will affect the containing function

#### How to check for optimization

1. Make a function that contains the pattern
2. The return value of `%GetOptimizationStatus(fn)` shows to what degree is the function `fn` optimized.
3. Call it two times to go from `uninitialized` to `monomorphic`
4. Use `%OptimizeFunctionOnNextCall(fn)` to instruct V8 to optimize this function immediately
5. Run it with `node --trace_opt --trace_deopt --allow-natives-syntax`

#### Patterns

* Note: even if the code is not reachable, it will still prevent the containing function from being optimized
* Currently not optimizable
  * `yield` and `function *()`
  * `for..of`
  * `try..catch` or `try..finally`
  * compound `let`
  * compound `const`
  * `__proto__`, `get`, `set`
  * `switch` with more than 128 `case`
* Likely never optimizable
  * `debugger`
  * `eval()`
  * `with`
* `eval()` and `with` breaks lexical scoping
* Workarounds
  * Break unoptimizable code into minimal functions so the callee won't be affected
  * e.g. return different results in `try..catch`, let the callee use the return value to decide what to do next

#### `arguments`

* Reassigning a defined parameter while also mentioning `arguments` in the body, e.g. 

  ```javascript
  function defaultArgsReassign(a, b) {
       if (arguments.length < 2) b = 5;
  }
  ```
  Solution:
    * Leave the argument, use a copy and reassign to that copy
    * Just checking for `undefined` is enough in many cases
    * Enable `use strict`
* Leaking `arguments` to somewhere else e.g. return it, pass it to another function, put it in closure
  * Solution: copy to an array
  * Bluebird has a macro in the build step to do this
* Assigning to `arguments`
  * Why would you do that anyway?!
* Calling methods on `arguments` e.g. `arguments.slice`
* Safe `arguments` usage
  * `argument.length`
  * `argument[i]` where `i` is valid and not out-of-bound
  * `x.apply(y, arguments)`(`Function#apply` is special)

#### For-in

* When the key is not local(referenced from outer scope/referenced in inner scope)
* When the iterated object is in dictionary mode
  * Added a lot of properties dynamically(outside constructor)
  * `delete` properties
  * Keys that can't be identifiers(note: digits!)
  * Use `%HasFastProperties(obj)` to check for this
* There are enumerable properties on the prototype chain
  * `Object.prototype.fn = function() {};`
  * Use `Object.defineProperty` to make it unenumerable
* Use `Object.keys` to avoid `for-in`. If you do need it, make it isolated in a small function

#### Infinite loops

* `while(true)` / `for (;;)` with deep logic exit conditions or unclear exit conditions
* Make the exit condition clearer
* Make the logic shallow

#### Resources

* A good documentation on V8 runtime functions: [thlorenz/v8-runtime-functions](https://github.com/thlorenz/v8-runtime-functions)
