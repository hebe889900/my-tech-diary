### [Communicating Between Views in Client-Side Apps](https://bocoup.com/weblog/communicating-between-views-in-client-side-apps)

#### The naive approach

Tightly coupled(what you normally see in jQuery app code), changing a component's DOM in another component's DOM event handler

#### Pub/sub

* Make a central channel like this: `var pubsub = _.extend({}, Backbone.Events)`
* Fire events in one component's DOM event handler(possibly cleaning the data before passing into the handler) - fire and forget
* Listen to the event in another components initializer and bind callbacks
* **Downside**
  * No good **namespacing**
  * Need to tare down event handlers to avoid **memory leaks**
  * The events are **"global"** to other components
  * Debugging can be painful since you might not be able to **find all the subscribers**

#### Evented Views

* Fire the events on the component. Any one who want to listen to these events must have a reference to the component
  * No namespacing problems anymore
* Since the handlers are bounded to the component(with reference), when the component is destroyed, the handlers will go with it

#### Application model

* Events are happening on a (UI) model. Updates are done with changes on the model data

#### Conclusion

* You can use some combination of all these methods in you app
* You need to avoid making any view with direct knowledge of another view, unless they are parent-children

### [References, Routing, And The Event Aggregator: Coordinating Views In Backbone.js](https://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/07/19/references-routing-and-the-event-aggregator-coordinating-views-in-backbone-js/)

* So the first one: instantiate and render a view(A) in another view(B). Move away! Tightly coupled code coming through!
* The next stop: instantiate view A outside of the view B, then bind view A to view B and let the view B update it with `this.anotherView.render()` 
* Next: the **mighty router**. Let the router listen to changes of the hash, and then clean data in one view, pass them to the methods of another
* Finally: the **event aggregator**. Make a central channel with something like this: `var pubsub = _.extend({}, Backbone.Events)`, bind it to different views, let the views listen to the events in their initializer, fire events in one view, handle events in another.
