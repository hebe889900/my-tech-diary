## [A tour of V8: Garbage Collection](http://jayconrod.com/posts/55/a-tour-of-v8-garbage-collection)

### Write barriers: the secret ingredient

* **Problem**: an object in the old-space with all its pointers to objects in the new-space
  * Can't scan the old-space when GC'ing new-space, that would make it too expensive
* **Solution**
  * **Store buffer**: a list of pointers from the old-space to the new-space
  * **Write-barrier**: executed to detects and records pointers to new-space when they are written to old-space objects
    * It's not cheap, but **write is not that common**, so we can afford it
  * Some other GC(not V8) have read barriers(Spidermonkey used to [have it](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Internals/Garbage_collection)..not sure about now), this needs hardware support to reduce overhead
* Other optimizations
  * Skip write-barrier when Crankshaft can **staically prove** that an object is in new-space
  * Allocate objects **on the stack** when there's **no non-local reference** to them -- obviously they don't need w-b
  * Masking off the 20 bits in the address to find it's page(1MB aligned), then check the **page header** to determine if both objects are in old/new-space. This can simplify the process.
  * Perodically **sort/dedup/update** the store buffer
