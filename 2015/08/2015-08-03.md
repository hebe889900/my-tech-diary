### Ask Sublime to ignore files

```javascript
"file_exclude_patterns": ["*.pyc","*.pyo","*.exe","*.dll","*.obj","*.o","*.a",
                          "*.lib","*.so","*.dylib","*.ncb","*.sdf","*.suo","*.pdb",
                          "*.idb",".DS_Store","*.class","*.psd",
                          "*.db","*.sublime-workspace"],
"folder_exclude_patterns": [".svn",".git",".hg","CVS","node_modules"]
```

## CORS

### OPTIONS instead of POST

When you trigger an non-simple CORS request, the browser will first send an OPTIONS(the preflight request).

The CORS request is only simple when:

1. The method is one of GET, HEAD or POST
2. If the method is POST, the `Content-Type` should be one of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, or `text/plain`(Therefore `application/json` will make the request preflighted)
3. It doesn't use custom headers

In this case the server needs to response with a 2XX for this preflight request, and `Allow-*` headers should be set properly, too. Then the browser will automatically initiate the actual CORS request. Again, your server needs to response with correct headers for it.
