## Software Engineering

### [How Chromium Works](https://medium.com/@aboodman/in-march-2011-i-drafted-an-article-explaining-how-the-team-responsible-for-google-chrome-ships-c479ba623a1b)

#### No branches

* Why: they release every day, and Chrome moves very fast
* Create short-lived maintenance branches
* Make fixes on the maintenance branches, then **cherry-pick** them to merge

#### Runtime switches

* Why: compile-time switches are no better than branches
* Compile and test every feature under all configurations at the beginning
* Use command-line flags to turn it on/off, it's easier to test
* When it's nearly complete, put it in `chrome://flags`. Finally when it's ready, enable it by default

#### Tests

* To release everyday and make sure the codebase is in a good state, you need a lot of automated tests
* Don't leave any broken changes in the tree

#### Refactoring

* Huge amount of tests enables aggressive refactoring
* Clean and understandable code is more important than preventing regressions
* Refactoring can reveal insufficient test coverage

#### Dependencies

* Daily integration, find the bugs as soon as possible
* Have a bot to watch out for breaking changes of the dependencies
* Don't make any local changes to the dependencies. Get it into the upstream.

#### Challenges

* Flaky integration tests -> the team start to ignore it -> disable it -> BOOM! Big regressions to the users!
* Hard to get every detail right when the release is so frequent
* Stressful, you might never get any rest if you want to keep your part working -> maybe modularization helps
