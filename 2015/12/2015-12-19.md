### Node.js at Uber

#### At first

* It's built with Node.js from the start
* The mobile client -> The real time bit(in Node) -> the post processing bit(in Python)
* The iOS guys preferred snake case and the Andriod guys preferred camel case, and they had to provide an API that can handle both(and it didn't occur to anyone that they can say, NO)

#### What matters

* SOA
  * Mentioned Steve Yegge's *the Platform rant*, LOL)
* Reliable routing
* Efficient protocols
  * [TChannel](https://github.com/uber/tchannel)
* Testing

#### (Don't know what this heading should be)

* They really try to build a complex, reliable distributed system in Node, not just use it as a thin layer for data access/rendering or whatnot

> If this community needs to grow in the future, the advanced stuff that we're doing at Uber, the cutting-edge stuff that we're doing at Uber, the cutting-edge stuff that people are doing at IBM, at Walmart, all these places -- is the stuff that we as a community have to embrace, because that's how we will thrive. We won't thrive by building endless express apps...we should be pushing our boundaries and saying, "what is the next expectation that we have for Node?"

This speech deserves an ovation.
