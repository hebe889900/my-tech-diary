### [Relationship between a kernel and a user thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1178785/relationship-between-a-kernel-and-a-user-thread)

#### Mapping

* Kernel threads can call priviledged services/syscalls and the kernel keeps track of them for allocated resources/schedules, etc.
* If your have many user threads use the services and resources provided by one kernel thread, and they **uses syscalls frequently**, they will be slowed down because the resource of one kernel thread is, after all, limited.
* But, if your user threads **doesn't need that many syscalls**, assigning a large number of user threads to one kernel thread can improve the utilization
* Note that the more kernel threads you have, the slower the system, as a whole, will be

#### Implementation

* Manage a **thread table**(like the process table in the kernel)
* Keep track of each thread's program counter, stack pointer, registers, state, etc.
* When the running thread go to blocked state, save its data(e.g. registers), choose a ready thread, reload its data, then run this thread instead -- implementing **context switch**
  * This is why people need user-level threading libraries because doing this light-weight context switch is **much faster** than trapping to the kernel
* Need to implement some **scheduling algorithms**

### [An Introduction to libuv - THREADS](https://nikhilm.github.io/uvbook/threads.html)

> `uv_thread_t` is just an alias for pthread_t on Unix, but this is an implementation detail, avoid depending on it to always be true.

### [Does node.js use threads/thread pool internally?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20346097/does-node-js-use-threads-thread-pool-internally)

libuv ultimately uses the blocking stdio to do FS I/O(Because AIO is not good enough). Each thread in its thread pool doing that is blocked.

Reference: [src/unix/fs.c](https://github.com/libuv/libuv/blob/v1.x/src/unix/fs.c#L271)

```c
if (req->off < 0) {
  if (req->nbufs == 1)
    result = read(req->file, req->bufs[0].base, req->bufs[0].len);
  else
    result = readv(req->file, (struct iovec*) req->bufs, req->nbufs);
} else {
  if (req->nbufs == 1) {
    result = pread(req->file, req->bufs[0].base, req->bufs[0].len, req->off);
    goto done;
  }
...
done:
  return result;
```
