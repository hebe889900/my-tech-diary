## Frontend

Couldn't make the page responsive until I realized I forgot about `<meta name=viewport content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`

From [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/ConfigureViewport?hl=en):

> When a page does not specify a viewport, mobile browsers will render that page at a fallback width ranging from 800 to 1024 CSS pixels. The page scale factor is adjusted so that the page fits on the display, forcing users to zoom before they can interact with the page.

## JS

Wrote [a blog about Promise](http://alinode.aliyun.com/blog/5) and was corrected that Promise/A came before libraries like bluebird/Q, etc.(roughly the same time as CommonJS)

A friend asked me about `await`ing arrays(since co can handle `yield`ing arrays), but I think using observables(still in stage 1 in ES2016) should be much more suitable for this kind of job.
