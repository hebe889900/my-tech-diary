#### Views

React components are views. A typical component `.js` file looks like this:

```javascript
// require, import, whatever
var ActionCreators = require('...');
var StoreA = require('...');
var StoreB = require('...');
var React = require('react');

// helper function, just to keep it DRY
function getStateFromStores() {
  return {
    a: StoreA.getAllA(),
    b: StoreB.getAllB()
  };
}

var Component = React.createClass({
  propTypes: {
    // like type annotations, for maintainablity
  }
  // react component definition...
  getInitialState: function() {
    // Store -> states
    return getStateFromStores();
  },
  componentDidMount: function() {
    // register listeners, so every time
    // the store changes, this view will
    // receive notifications and reload states from stores
    // essentially bind stores to view
    StoreA.addChangeListener(this._onChange);
    StoreB.addChangeListener(this._onChange);
  },
  componentWillUnmount: function() {
    // detach listeners to avoid memory leak
    StoreA.removeChangeListener(this._onChange);
    StoreB.removeChangeListener(this._onChange);
  }
  render: function() {
    // referencing `this.props` and `this.state` heavily
    // note `this.props` are passed by parents,
    // `this.states` can change and is what the
    // flux pattern will manage
    // for event handlers, use things like `this._onClick`
  },
  _onClick: function() {
    // take actions
    ActionCreator.someAction(
      /* usually the arguments are obtained with `this.props`*/
    );
  },
  _onChange: function() {
    // Event handler for 'change' events coming from the stores
    this.setState(getStateFromStores());
  }
});

module.exports = Component;  // or export, whatever
```

#### Actions

[Action and the Dispatcher](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/actions-and-the-dispatcher.html)

The actions are abstracted as objects here. Each actions includes:

* Action data
* Action type(think of them as event names)

*Action creators* are created to:

* Create the action objects
* Pass(dispatch) the action to the dispatcer

> In a Flux application, both stores and views control themselves; they are not acted upon by external objects. Actions flow into the stores through the callbacks they define and register, not through setter methods


There are two type of actions: from views, or from other source e.g. servers.

A typical view action creator looks like this:

```javascript
var SomeDispatcher = require('...');
var ActionCreatorForServerEvents = require('...');
var ActionConstants = require('...'); // defined constants, mostly action types

var ActionTypes = ActionConstants.ActionTypes;

var ActionCreatorForViewEvents = {
  // usually comes form view
  actionFromView: function(data) {
    // notify store about creation, usually store will
    // notify views again for simple updates
    SomeDispatcher.dispatch({
      type: ActionTypes.SOME_VIEW_ACTION,
      data: data
    });
    // convert the data to something to be persisted
    // send the data to server/local storage, etc.
    // e.g. initiate AJAX
    sendActionToServer().then(function(response) {
      // this call will dispatch another action
      // again so that the store
      // can be updated properly when the request is successful
      ActionCreatorForServerEvents.actionFromServer(response);
    });
  }
};

module.exports = ActionCreatorForViewEvents;
```

Action creator for things like server events looks like this:

```javascript
var SomeDispatcher = require('...');

var ActionConstants = require('...'); // defined constants, mostly action types

var ActionTypes = ActionConstants.ActionTypes;

var ActionCreatorForServerEvents = {
  actionFromServer: function(response) {
    SomeDispatcher.dispatch({
      type: SOME_SERVER_ACTION,
      data: response.data
    });
  }
};

module.exports = ActionCreatorForServerEvents;
```


Most of the time it just dispatch some action for each of its methods

#### Dispatcher

Interface:

* `waitFor`
* `dispath` (like event emitters)
* `register` (like event listeners)

The difference between a dispatcher and a event utility/pubsub utility is that:

* It has `waitFor`
* `dispatch` provides synchronous iteration

`waitFor` is used to solve dependency problems between stores. Each time `waitFor` is encountered in an iteration, the callback triggering it will be paused, and a new iteration over the dependency will begin. When this iteration ends, that callback will be resumed.

#### [Redux and Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/Discussion/issues/362)

Hmm...not a good couple after all.

#### [Flux.js](https://github.com/vuejs/Discussion/issues/362)

> Flux is more of a pattern than a framework, and does not have any hard dependencies. However, we often use EventEmitter as a basis for Stores and React for our Views. The one piece of Flux not readily available elsewhere is the Dispatcher. This module, along with some other utilities, is available here to complete your Flux toolbox.
