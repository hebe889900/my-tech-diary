### Rebase

#### [Git Branching - Rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing)

* use `fixup`/`squash` can merge multiple commits into one
* If there are someone else developing on branches grown out of the same branch that you will eventually merge into, periodically `git rebase` your own branch to the head of that main branch can
save you a lot of conflicts later
* If someone on your team force pushes changes that overwrite work that youâ€™ve based work on, use `git pull --rebase` can help you make it work

## [What a Deep Neural Network thinks about your `#selfie`](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/10/25/selfie/)

#### Features of ConvNets

* Simple: one operation(convolution) repeated few tens of times on the image
* Fast
* Work well
* Work [similar to our own visual cortex](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3284)

### How does it work

* Taking convolutions with different filters on an image(so with 10 filters and a 256x256 color image, the data will be transformed from (256, 256, 3) -> (256, 256, 10))
* For each pass, take convolutions on the previous result with another set of filters
* In the final pass, compute the probability of visual classes for the image

#### Training

* The target for training is what kind of filters that we are going to use
* The initial set is randomly chosen
* Yet another try-and-score-and-adjust process

> ConvNet is just expressing a function from image pixels to class probabilities with the filters as parameters, and we run stochastic gradient descent to optimize a classification loss function.

#### The project

* Dataset
  * Grab `#selfie`s with at least on face
  * Must be online at least for one month so the statistics are stable
  * Labeled with "good" or "bad" accroding to
    * Number of seens and likes
    * Tags
    * Number of followers
  * Group the images in 100, take the top 50 as "good", the bottom 50 as "bad"
* Implementation
  * Used Caffe
  * VGGNet pretrained on ImageNet(suprisingly better than VGGNet pretrained on images with faces), finetuned on the selfie dataset
  * No dropout
