## Node.js

### [Writing cross-platform Node.js](http://shapeshed.com/writing-cross-platform-node/)

* Use the `path` module to handle anything related to FS paths
* Use the `os` module for anything related to OS(newline characters, file locations..)
* Do not reply on shebangs when writing package.json i.e. don't write `./bin/xx.js`, write `node bin/xx.js`
* To run multiple commands in one line, use `&&` instead of `&`
