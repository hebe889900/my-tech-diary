## Vue

### [Why Vue.js doesn't support templateURL](http://vuejs.org/2015/10/28/why-no-template-url/)

* For a Vue.js component, its template and its JavaScript is tightly coupled by nature
* If you go with AJAX'ing those templates, it will cost you quite a bit with all those little requests because we don't have HTTP/2 at our disposal(yet). And if you go with `$templateCache`, well it's inevitable to have some build process in your frontend devlopment anyway.
* So, use Browserify or WebPack, then you can write [single file components](http://vuejs.org/guide/application.html#Single_File_Components), and [lazy load them](http://vuejs.org/guide/components.html#Async_Components) if needed.
