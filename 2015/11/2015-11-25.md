## SVG

* To make the focus on multi-series lines
  * Get x-position of the mouse with `d3.mouse()`
  * Find x-value with `xScale.invert(xPos)`
  * Find the y-values on each line with bisect or what ever(when a simple `data[x]` won't do)
  * Find y-positions with `yScale(yValue)`
  * Draw circles originated from those points
* To make a grid with alternating fill
  * Make normal grids with `d3.svg.axis()`, set `innerTickSize` to `-width`/`-height` and `outerTickSize` to 0. Then `selectAll('.tick')` and append `rect` the same width/height as each grid. Use `rangeBand()` if you can, or simply get the ticks with `.ticks()`, then use things like `x(xTick[1]) - x(xTick[2])` to calculate what you need
* To wrap the labels
  * After calling axis functions, `selectAll('.tick text')` and call a function to break up the text into pieces, call `text.text(null)`, then put the pieces into `<tspan>` and put them back in the `<text>`
