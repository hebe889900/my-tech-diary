### [select / poll / epoll: practical difference for system architects](http://www.ulduzsoft.com/2014/01/select-poll-epoll-practical-difference-for-system-architects/)

#### epoll

* Why is it so great
  * It keeps the information inside the kernel
* Usage: `epoll_create()` -> `epoll_ctl()` -> `epoll_wait()`

  ```cpp
  int pollingfd = epoll_create( 0xCAFE ); // the argument will be ignored(= =)

  // set up event
  struct poll_event ev = {0};
  ev.data.ptr = ptrConnection;
  ev.events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLONESHOT;

  // add the descriptor to the monitoring list
  if ( epoll_ctl( epollfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, ptrConnection->getSocket(), &ev ) != 0 )
      // report error

  // wait for 20 events for 10s
  struct epoll_event pevents[ 20 ];
  int ret = epoll_wait( pollingfd, pevents, 20, 10000 );

  // Check if epoll actually succeed
  if ( ret == -1 ) {
    // report error and abort
  } else if ( ret == 0 ) {
    // timeout; no event detected
  } else {
    // Check if any events detected
    // Note: only triggered events will be filled into pevents
    // and the count will be returned
    // So you don't need that O(N) checking
    for ( int i = 0; i < ret; i++ ) {
      if ( pevents[i].events & EPOLLIN ) {
        // Get back our connection pointer
        Connection * c = (Connection*) pevents[i].data.ptr;
        c->handleReadEvent();
       }
    }
  }
  ```
* Advantages
  * Only return what's needed -- triggered events
  * You can attach the pointer to a **context** to `pevent.data.ptr` and get it back later(although you have to break type safety here)
  * You can add/remove sockets and modify descriptors in another thread
  * You can implement edge triggering with it
  * You can use multiple threads to wait on the same epoll queue with `epoll_wait`! And it's in fact recommended in edge triggering mode!
* Disadvantages
  * Changing event flags will be done in the kernel space -> context switch!
  * For a new connection socket you need to `accept()` then `epoll_ctl()`, so you need to call two syscalls, which will take longer if you have many short-lived connections
  * It's Linux only
  * Harder to debug in edge triggering mode(prone to deadlocks)
* **Only use `epoll` when**
  * You have a **thread pool** to handle many connections -- epoll usually can't outperform poll in a single threaded application
  * You have a **large number of sockets**(say, >1000) and **long-lived connections** to handle. If the number of sockets is small, there's no significant benefits. If the connections are short-lived, those extra system calls will slow you down.
  * You **only need to support Linux** or you are building a wrapper around epoll
