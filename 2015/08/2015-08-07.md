## Node.js

### [Generators vs Fibers](http://howtonode.org/generators-vs-fibers)

* The run-to-finish semantics of JS makes using shared variables safe, but if you `yield`, race conditions could happen:

  ```javascript
  var requestCount = 0;
    function* handleRequest(req) {
      requestCount++;
      var result = yield query(req);
      result.requestCount = requestCount; // Uh-Oh!
      return new Buffer(JSON.stringify(result) + "\n");
    }
  ```
  But you can use `yield *` so solve this.
* The key problem: blocks I/O without blocking the process


### [Does node.js use threads/thread pool internally?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20346097/does-node-js-use-threads-thread-pool-internally/20346545#20346545)

* Interestingly, libuv ultimately uses stdio `read`.

* Wow, callback counters looks evil...
* "Maybe"s are better handled by events

## JS Engine

### [V8 Design Elements](https://developers.google.com/v8/design?hl=en)
* Fast Property Access: hidden classes
* Dynamic Machine Code Generation: inline caches and OSR
* Efficient Garbage Collection: stop-the-world, generational, accurate, incremental

### [Garbage collection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Internals/Garbage_collection)

* Spidermonkey uses mark-and-sweep, generation and compaction are still under construction.
* Spidermonkey has read and write barrier(but V8 only has write barrier)
  * Write barrier: snapshot-at-the-beginning
* Incremental marking with mark stack
  * If the mutator generates too much allocation(thus run out of memory), Spidermonkey will switch to a non-incremental GC
* Spidermonkey mainly uses zones now.
