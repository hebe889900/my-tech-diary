### [New JavaScript techniques for rapid page loads](http://blog.chromium.org/2015/03/new-javascript-techniques-for-rapid.html)

#### Script streaming: optimizes parsing

* Before: parsing starts after the script is loaded. Wastes CPU when waiting for the download to complete.
* After: parses `async` and `defer` scripts on a separate thread while downloading
  * Only needs a few more milliseconds for parsing after the script is downloaded. Then compile & execute
  * 10% faster
  * Effective on **large scripts and slow network connectinons**

#### Code caching

* Store a local copy of the compiled code. When the user revisit the page, downloading/parsing/compiling are all skipped.
* Avoid about 40% compile time, saves battery

## Optimizations for mobile Web

### Images

* WebP
* 2x, compress your images
* Use low resolution images under slow connections
* Use CSS/SVG/icon font instead of images
* Lazy load

#### Networking

* Fewer domains to save DNS lookup cost
* Fewer requests(concatenation, inlining, avoid redirection etc.)
* Minification, dead code elimination, Gzip
* Use App cache and Local Storage for caching
