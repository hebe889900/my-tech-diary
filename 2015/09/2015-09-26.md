## JS Engine

### [Lars Bak and Steve Lucco: Chakra, V8, JavaScript, Open Source](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Lars-Bak-and-Steve-Lucco-Chakra-V8-JavaScript-Open-Source)

* Initial design of V8
  * Make sure similar objects in JS will be handled by the same machine code
  * Need a good memory management system
* Study on JS patterns of web pages
  * Most downloaded code won't be executed frequently
  * Common libraries/frameworks
  * Only measuring existing code is not enough, because the code on the Web themselves will try to play well with old engines. You need to look ahead.
* Chakra
  * Concurrent GC
* Challenges
  * Predictable performance for games
  * Broaden the *sweet spot*(optimization patterns)
* Usually JS performance is not the bottleneck in web apps
* Lars Bak: "Unlike Miscrosoft, we departed from interpretation" "Bytecode is sort of the...um...silly kinda thing in my mind" LOL
  * In JS, the wire format is the source code, so the bytecode won't bring any benefits for portability, unlike .NET/Java
  * And you have to implement `Function.prototype.toString()` anyway, so why bother?
* Steve Lucco: why interpreter
  * Need to load the web pages as fast as possible. Generator bytecode is faster(oh really?)
  * It's easier to do profiling(put it in the interpreter)
  * Security concerns
* About web apps and Node.js
  * They run much longer, so they need better memory management
  * The heap size limit(2G) of V8
  * Concurrent GC, incremental GC...but all of them still need to synchronize with the mutator so there will always be pauses
* Why reference counting is crap
  * You need to have a counter for each object, and you need a lock for it...
  * Cycles. You need a background process to track them down and break them or have some kind of weak references
  * It doesn't scale in terms of heap size
  * You have no type safety in JS, so doing reference counting is not really practical
  * Not as memory-safe as GC
* Resource constraint
  * It's not right to say using one core saves the battery -- you need to minimize the *rush-to-idle* time to save battery, and using multicore usually can help you with that
  * On mobile phones usually it's not the CPU that's slow, it's the memory that's slow(and limited)
  * Usually on mobile web apps are not CPU-bound(unless you do a lot of computation e.g. on triangles), but are memory-bound. You need to make sure stuff can get into the CPU cache properly
* About implementation language
  * Chakra: mostly C, a bit of C++(they even have to have a meeting first if they want to put some template code in it LOL)
  * V8: a restricted subset of C++, basically C with abstract data type
