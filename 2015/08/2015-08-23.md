## CSS Secrets

### Web standards: friend or foe?

#### Standardization

* The majority of WG members come from W3C member companies. And there are a few invited experts(competent developers). They are the people who *make* the standards, not the W3C staff.
* The standardization process:
  1. Editor's Draft: collection of ideas, not requirements, no guarantee
  2. First Public Working Draft: first published version, ready for feedback by the WG
  3. Working Draft: many versions, improved one by one. Implementation starts.
  4. Candidate Recommendation: relatively stable. Need a full test suite and at least two independent implementations to go on.
  5. Proposed Recommendation: rare. For disagreements
  6. Recommendation: final stage.

#### Standards

1. CSS1, 1996, very short and simple, 68p
2. CSS2, 1998, more strictly defined, 480p

Since to get the spec to the final stage, **every single feature** needs to be approved, so they break it into modules.

Those that expand on features that already showed up in CSS 2.1 will labeled level 3. Those entirely new specs are labeled level 1.

There are no CSS3 in the specs. It's a buzzword.

#### Vendor prefixes

* Hard to improve the specs because the implementation might be too popular
* Use config flags to prevent it from being too popular
