## Web

### fetch API

* By default, it doesn't send cookies. To send them you need to put

  ```javascript
  {
    credentials: 'same-origin'
  }
  ```
  in the options
* The response need to be parsed further: e.g. `res.text()`, `res.json()`, `URL.createObjectURL(response.blob())`, etc.

## Koa

Seems the koa-router doesn't support

```javascript
var router = new Router({
  prefix: 'pre'
});

router.use(someMiddleware);
router.get('/', anotherMiddleware);

// visit '/pre', then only `anotherMiddleware` will be called.
// visit '/pre/', then both the middlewares will be called
```
Looked into the source code, there's a default prefix `/(.*)` standing in the way. Might make a PR later when I've got the time..

## Vue

If you accidentally set `template: 'id-to-template'` instead of `template: '#id-to-template'`, you will get some really annoying behavior..(a fragment component with a single string, ugh!)
