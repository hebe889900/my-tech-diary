## JS

### [Building High-Performing JavaScript for Modern Engines

* Don't do unnecessary work -- hold it at 60fps even when you can do, like, 120fps, so you can leave more time for the CPU. `requestAnimationFrame` is a good fit for this.
* Avoid DOM manipulation
* Cache and cast values from the DOM. Coersion and conversion take time too

#### Property access

* Chakra also has something like the hidden classes(vtable-like)
* Add all properties in the constructor
* Chakra also resort to the hash table representation when the properties are `delete`d
* If there are **too many properties**(which is not uncommon if you use inheritance), the object will also go into hash table mode
* Use **identifiers** for property names
* ES5 getters and setters are not optimized in IE9-
* Don't add properties conditionally
* Don't **default properties on prototypes**, just set them in the constructor. It will lead to too many intermediate types and stress the GC

#### Arithmetics

* Use integers to avoid boxing
* Use floating point math judiciously
* Type specialized functions
  * Use arguments of consistent types
  * Bailout to interpreter mode, wait until being hot again, wait on JIT queue...

#### Arrays

* Take advantages of typed arrays to avoid the overhead of tagging and boxing
* Don't use objects as arrays or use arrays as objects
* Preallocate arrays
* Enumerate arrays properly
  * `forEach` might introduce closures which is bad news to GC
