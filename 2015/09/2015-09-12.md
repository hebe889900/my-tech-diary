### [D3 within React the right way](http://oli.me.uk/2015/09/09/d3-within-react-the-right-way/)

#### The problem

* To use D3 with React, you typically need to pulls the SVG node out of the virtual DOM and manipulate the SVG by yourself. Thats what [react-d3-wrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-d3-wrap) does.
* [d3-react](https://github.com/Olical/d3-react) inject a plugin into `d3`'s prototype and convert the detached and mutated DOM node to React elements for you.
  * It limits the D3 API you can use in your components
  * It blows away all the virtual DOM goodness, throwing away the real DOM tree after every mutation and render!

#### Solution

* Build a fake DOM that supports just enough methods to get the D3 working: [react-faux-dom](https://github.com/Olical/react-faux-dom).
* Isomorphic charts!

## JS

### [Geoff Schmidt: JavaScript State of the Union -- Devshop SF July 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G2SMVIUNNk)

* Apps are stateful(unlike browsers, which are typically stateless) and have their local DBs
* JS used to only have three roles: making things blink, making things scroll, and putting up popups, LOL
* JS is the only reasonable language for cross platform app development
* JS has the potential, but that's it. It doesn't come with everything out of the box
  * Data replication
  * Reactive rendering & optimistic UI
* We need more standards for the JS app platform
* Advertising on Meteor, blahblahblah....
