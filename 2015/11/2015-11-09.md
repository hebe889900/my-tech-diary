### Vue

There might be somehing wrong in Vue v1.0.0, not sure yet and don't have time to open an issue with a fiddle reproducing this...

I have a component with properties bounded to it's parent's computed data and some computed status, and it will do some special rendering in the `attached` hook.

```html
<comp v-bind:data="computedData" v-if="computedStatus === 'done'"></comp>
```

And the parent update the dependency asynchronously via AJAX callbacks(in a promise), like this:

```javascript
function someAction() {
  // dispatch an action so the `computedStatus` in that VM will be 'loading'
  ajax(...).then(function(res) {
  // dispatch an action so the `computedStatus` will be `done`
  // and the `computedData` will be populated with the response
  });
}
```

When the actions are interleaved(like, when the first action is still 'loading', I start another action, so instead of `loading -> done -> loading -> done` the order will be `loading -> loading -> done -> done`), the data binding won't be updated properly. Even if I deliberately add a temporary trigger before I set the status to `done` (so it would be `loading -> loading -> loading(short-lived) -> done loading(short-lived) -> done` it still doesn't work. The computation hook in the parent will be triggered twice by `done`, but the `attached` hook will only be triggered during the first update. Strangely if I `watch` the property for changes, I can capture that second update. But as far as I know, watching properties without two-way binding should've been pointless because the data flow is unidirectional, and the properties should be re-bounded every time the component is attached...

Ahh..when I'm writing this I think I've discovered what's wrong with it. Updating the data bounded to the component won't trigger a rerendering so the `attached` hook won't be called(maybe I just think in the React way too much LOL). Though I still don't quite understand why adding that temporary trigger did't help...`v-if` should've force a rerendering...maybe I need to combine it with `$nextTick()`?
