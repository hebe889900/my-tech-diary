## CSS

### Pure CSS popover

1. Make a wrapper, an anchor, a popover

  ```html
  <div class="wrapper">
    <div class="anchor">Anchor</div>
    <div class="popover">This is a popover</div>
  </div>
  ```
2. The wrapper should be `position: relative` so the popover can be `position: absolute` and be taken out from the normal flow

  ```css
  .wrapper {
    position: relative;
  }

  .popover {
    position: absolute;
    z-index: 1000;  /* should be on top of the content */
  }
  ```
3. Add some style to the popover, notably the `box-shadow`

  ```css
  .popover {
    padding: 14px 20px;
    border-radius: 3px;

    box-shadow: 0 0 6px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
    background-color: white;
  }
  ```
4. Make a little triangle for the popover:

  ```css
  .popover:after {
    /* give it a size */
    content: " ";
    width: 14px;
    height: 14px;
    display: block;

    /* We don't use border to make a triangle here,
       because thay we won't be able to make a triangular shadow */
    transform: rotate(45deg);
    /* The x- and y-offset
       1. must be the same
       2. must be negative
       3. must be no smaller than the blur radius
       so the shadow can point upwards without giving a tell.

      Note the color of the shadow should be lighter
      because it will be a little dense
      since we don't have much room for it */
    box-shadow: -3px -3px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    
    /* Place it before the whole popover */
    position: absolute;
    /* This should be half of the width/height
       so only the triangular half will show up */
    top: -7px;

    background-color: white;
  }
  ```
5. For some animation:

  ```css
  .popover {
    transform: translateY(0px);  /* so it can slide down later */
    transition: all 0.2s ease;
  }
  ```
6. By default the popover should be invisible:

  ```css
  .popover {
    opacity: 0;
    pointer-events: none;  /* so it won't react to the pointer */
  }
  ```
7. Now, use the `:hover` pseudo-class to make the popover show when the anchor is hovered. Note the dimension of the `.wrapper` doesn't include this popover because it's `position: absolute`

  ```css
  .wrapper:hover .popover {
    transform: translateY(10px);  /* slide down a bit */
    opacity: 1;
    pointer-events: auto;
  }
  ```
8. Finally, to avoid the flicker(appearing when the use move the mouse to the space between the anchor and the popover content), make a transparent area to catch the mouse:

  ```css
  .popover:before {
    content: " ";
    width: 100%;   /* same width as the popover */
    height: 14px;  /* same height as the triangle */
    display: block;

    position: absolute;
    left: 0;
    top: -14px;  /* same as its height, to fill the whole gap */
  }
  ```
