## Messaging API

### `window.postMessage()`

Encounter `Uncaught DataCloneError: Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'Window': An object could not be cloned.` when I try to post a message with a XHR object, turns out objects with methods can be serialized just like that. You can `JSON.stringify` it then `JSON.parse` it, but in the case of XHR this still doesn't work. So just copy out what you need instead.

### How to use it for cross-domain AJAX

It's pretty simple. Just embed a hidden `<iframe>` in your page, set the `src` to a URL in the other domain. In that `<iframe>`, you need to load a script that:

1. Listens for `message` events
2. Extract things from that message, use them to coin an AJAX request to its origin, and send it out
3. In the callback of that AJAX request, post a message containing the response back to where it receives the initial message(use `e.source` to find that window)

```javascript
window.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
    // NOTE: this request belongs to the origin of the iframe
    xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    // coin an XMLHttpRequest with e.data
    xhr.open(...);
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
      // use xhr.responseText and other things
      // to form a response data object
      e.source.postMessage(response, e.origin);
    };
    xhr.send(...);  // this could carry data from e.data
  })
```

Then in your web page, whenever you needs to send AJAX request to the other domain, use the `<iframe>` as a proxy by posting message to it(so it will send a request for you), and listening for message events that carries response data from that `<iframe>`.

```javascript
iframe.onload = function() {
  iframe.contentWindow.postMessage(requestData, anotherOrigin);
  window.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
    // e.data contains the response
  });
}
```
