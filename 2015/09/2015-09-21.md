## Node

Built node v5.0.0-pre with VS2015, and to my surprise, it went through pretty smoothly.

## HTTP

The status text of HTTP 418 is `I'm a teapot` LOL

## Chrome

### [GURL re-canonicalization unescapes a second time, can invalidate previously-valid URL](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=533361)

The root of evil -- double unescaping. And by [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.4):

> Implementations must not percent-encode or decode the same string more than once, as decoding an already decoded string might lead to misinterpreting a percent data octet as the beginning of a percent-encoding, or vice versa in the case of percent-encoding an already percent-encoded string.
