# Pure Javascript Carousel

I have interviewed a company called Founded CO and there is a interview question about designing an image carousel that loading two photo albums from web services.
Here is the detail requirements: 
 >You will be creating a mini web app that uses React, Node &
Express. This app will consist of a backend Express
server that will deliver a React app to be rendered in the
browser. The app that you will be building is a simple
image carousel that allows the user to pick between cat or
shark photos and then cycle through those photos. An
example of a running version of this can be seen here:
https://founded.media/hiring/videos/cat-shark-app.mp4

>The Express server besides delivering whats required for React should also provide an API endpoint
that will return one of 3 possible lists of photo URLs (please see attached lists). Your React app
should make a request to your API endpoint to retrieve a photo list. During this request the React
app should show a loading state. Once the photo list has been retrieved the loading state should
dismiss and the first photo should be shown. The user should now be able to cycle through the
photos using left and right arrow buttons. The user can use the UI to toggle between cat photos,
shark photos, or both (when both selected they should arrive in a random order). After each
change to the desired list the loading state should be shown just like during the initial load and a
new request to the photo API endpoint should be made (i.e. Do not cache the photo lists).

Do
> • Use Redux
• Be mindful of when to use props vs. state
• Use Webpack
• Be RESTful
• ES6+
• Use JS best practices
• Be creative

Don't 
>• Use 3rd party image carousels
• Over think the problem there's no
trick here

Photo list:

I worked on that project and failed on one of the requirement: don't use 3rd party image carousels. So I decided to learn javascript oo design and design pattern to create my own image carousel from scratch (No library use, even JQuery).
