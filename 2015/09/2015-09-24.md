### [Launching nginScript and Looking Ahead](https://www.nginx.com/blog/launching-nginscript-and-looking-ahead/)

* It's for adding more scripting ability to nginx
* It's a subset of JS
* Two parts
  * A custom VM and a byte-code compiler. Has fast startup and teardown time
  * Configuration snippets evaluated at runtime, can modify req/res on the fly and adjust operations specifically for each request
* Run a separate VM for each request, no GC(What?!)

#### What it enables

* Dynamic response to abusive traffic sources
* More flexible control
* Moving some functionality out of applications(you app code), into the application delivery platform(nginx)
* Rapid development, code reuse and distribution

#### How to use it

* `js_set`and `js_run` directive
* Access request parameters via `$r` variable
* `js_set` set the value to the result of executed JS code
  
  ```
  http {
      js_set $hello_world "
              var str = 'Hello World!';
              // JavaScript
              str;
      ";

      server {
          ...
          location /{
              return 200 $hello_world;
          }
      }
  }
  ```
* `js_run` executes JS and generates an HTTP response
  * Evaluated at the **content-generation stage**
  * Goes inside a `location` block
  * Example 

    ```
    location / {
        js_run "
            var res;
            res = $r.response;
            res.status = 200;
            res.send('Hello World!');
            res.finish();
        ";
    }
    ```
* Combining `js_set` and `js_run`, you can make routing and response generation much more  flexible
