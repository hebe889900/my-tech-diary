### [Compiling in the background for a smoother user experience](http://blog.chromium.org/2014/02/compiling-in-background-for-smoother.html)

* Before: the main thread first compile the code without optimization, then took turns to optimize the code and execute it
* After: the optimization is put into a background thread. Execution continues alongside compilation.
* Result: 27% improvement in Mandreel score of Octane 2.0

### [Loop-invariant code motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop-invariant_code_motion)

Turn code like this:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    x = y + z;
    a[i] = 6 * i + x * x;
}
```

into this:

```cpp
x = y + z;
t1 = x * x;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    a[i] = 6 * i + t1;
}
```
