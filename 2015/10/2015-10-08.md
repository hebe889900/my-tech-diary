## Node.js

### Clustering

#### The `cluster` module

Introduced in v0.8. A lot more improvements in v0.10-v0.12.

Useful API:

* `cluster.isMaster`
* `cluster.fork()` combined with `os.cpus().length`

Before v0.11, the load balancing is handled by OS - workers will listen on the same socket, the OS decide which one should take it.

But since context switch is expensive, the scheduler will tend to invoke just a subset of available processes. Most of the times this won't hurt that much, but when it does, it hurts HARD. So v0.11 introduced round-robin load balancing.

#### PM2

pm2 is an abstraction on top of the `cluster` module. It's quite heavy-weight and comes with some command-line tools. If you want fine-grained control, you can use the bare-minimum `cluster` API to implement your own system. But if you want to get it running ASAP, pm2 could be a good choice and save you a lot of boilerplate code. This can help you separate your operation logics from your application.

#### HAProxy and nginx

You can still use general-purpose alternatives like these. HAProxy is very lightweight and very good at load balancing, while nginx provide additional functionalities like caching, compression, serving static content, etc.
