## CSS

### Flexbox

If you set `flex-grow` and `width` at the same time, the element will behave like this(assuming `flex-direction: row;`and `flex-wrap: wrap;`):

* When the rest of the space in the row is larger than the `width`, the element will grow to fit the rest of the space, so it will be actually larger
* When the rest of the space in the row is not larger than the `width`, the element will take up the whole space, and overflow if necessary(if it can't shrink i.e. `flex-shrink` is `0`)
