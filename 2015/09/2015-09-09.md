## Backend

### [An Introduction to HAProxy and Load Balancing Concepts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-haproxy-and-load-balancing-concepts)

#### Access Control List(ACL)

For flexible network **traffic forwarding**. e.g. `acl url_blog path_beg /blog` matches urls begining with `/blog`

#### Backend

Servers that will **handle forwarded requests**. They are defined by
* Load balance algorithm
* A list of available servers and ports

e.g.

```
backend web-backend
    balance roundrobin
    server web1 web1.yourdomain.com:80 check
    server web2 web2.yourdomain.com:80 check

backend blog-backend
    balance roundrobin
    mode http
    server blog1 blog1.yourdomain.com:80 check
    server blog2 blog2.yourdomain.com:80 check
```

`check` tells it to check the heath of backend servers

#### Frontend

Defines **how requests should be forwarded**. They are defined by
  * A set of IP and a port
  * ACLs
  * `use_backend` rules(which backend to use)

#### Layer 4 Load Balancing

* Transport layer load balancing.
* Based on IP range/domain and port
* Backends should be kept in sync. They connect to the same DB server.

#### Layer 7 Load Balancing

* Application layer load balancing
* Based on the content of the user's request
* Can run multiple web server under **the same domain and port**

Example:

```
frontend http
  bind *:80
  mode http

  acl url_blog path_beg /blog
  use_backend blog-backend if url_blog

  default_backend web-backend
```

#### Load Balancing Algorithms

* Algorithms and weights
* `roundrobin`
  * In turns. Default.
* `Leastconn`
  * Selects the server with the **least number of connections**
  * Good for long sessions
  * Servers in the same backend are rotated in a round-robin fashion
* `source`
  * Based on a **hash of the source IP**
  * Makes sure that a user will connect to the same server

#### Miscellaneous

* Sticky Sessions: `appsession`
* Health Check: `check`
  * You don't have to manually remove an unavailable backend
  * Try to establish TCP connection to check for availability

#### Other options

* LVS
  * Simple & fast
  * Layer 4
  * Included in many Linux distributions
* nginx
  * Fast & reliable
  * Provide proxy and load-balancing, though it's essentially a web server
  * Can be used with HAProxy for **caching and compression**
