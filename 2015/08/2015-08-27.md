## Node.js

### [Alex Young: Node.js Internals - Great British Node Conf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWKgPq1hb6s)

* Source layout
* Inheritance & reuse(`util.inherit()` like `Object.create()`)
* Covered the 3rd party libraries
* Bootstrapping(`src/node.js`)
  * invoked by C++ (`node::Load`)
  * setup things like `process`
  * Use stdio to read JS source
  * Load core modules
  * Process management/signals
* `src/node.cc`
  * Compiles and executes `src/node.js`
  * CLI, V8, Exceptions, debugging, memory usage
* `process.binding` portal
* `NODE_SET_METHOD(process, "binding", Binding)` makes C++ functions available to JS(e.g. for addons)
* `ASYNC_CALL` expands to libuv
* Ask libuv to do the work(e.g. `uv__fs_work`) asynchronously with the thread pool
* FS are blocking, so they are wrapped in thread pools, but networking can be non-blocking, so they don't need to be wrapped that way
* Use `uv_queue_work` for blocking operations e.g. `crypto`
