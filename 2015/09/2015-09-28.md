## React

### [Why We Need a Dispatcher](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/07/30/flux-actions-and-the-dispatcher.html#why-we-need-a-dispatcher)

* Provide `waitFor()` to resolve the dependencies among stores
* `dispatch()` method provides a simple, **synchronous iteration** through the callbacks, invoking each in turn.
* When `waitFor()` is encountered in a callback, the execution stops, and **a new iteration cycle over the dependencies** is created. The callback will be resumed after all the dependencies are updated
* By calling `waitFor()` inside code blocks(say, in `switch` blocks), we can have fine-grained control over the dependencies(different dependencies for different actions)
* Circular dependencies are avoided by throwing errors in the dispatcher in Flux repo

## C++

### [CppCon 2015: Bjarne Stroustrup “Writing Good C++14”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OEu9C51K2A)

* Coding guidelines
  * High level rules for humans
  * Low level rules for tools
  * Supported by libraries: **GSL**!
* We need low-level features to implement the high-level ones and allow experts to have a fine-grained control over the code
* Avoid resource leaks
  * Root everything into a scope
  * Use abstractions, avoid naked `new` and `delete`
* Eliminating dangling pointers
  * Ownership
  * Raw pointers = non-owners
  * Catching pointers escape into a scope enclosing its owner's scope
    * `return`, `throw`, out-parameters, long-lived containers
  * Something that holds an owner is an owner
