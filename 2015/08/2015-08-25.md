## CSS

### [CSS Modules](http://glenmaddern.com/articles/css-modules)

Use `require` or `import` to load CSS in JS

```javascript
import styles from './submit-button.css';

buttonElem.outerHTML = `<button class=${styles.normal}>Submit</button>`
```

Compile to ICSS, like this

```html
<button class="components_submit_button__normal__abc5436">
  Processing...
</button>
```

#### Scoping

* Problem: currently CSS only has global scope
* Current solution: CSS methodologies like BEM with naming discipline
* With CSS modules: move the module prefixes to the file name,

#### Composition

```css
.common {
  /* all the common styles you want */
}
.normal {
  composes: common;
  /* anything that only applies to Normal */
}
```

like the @extends keyword in Sass.

This will generate things like:

```html
<button class="components_submit_button__common__abc5436 
               components_submit_button__normal__def6547">
  Submit
</button>
```

So you don't have to apply multiple classes yourself.

#### File scope

* With `@import` in LESS/SASS, you usually factor out a `variables.scss` or `settings.scss`
* With CSS Modules, you can `compose` from another file without polluting the global scope.

#### Single responsibility modules

* Declare our component in terms of reusable parts

  ```css
  .element {
    composes: large from "./typography.css";
    composes: dark-text from "./colors.css";
    composes: padding-all-medium from "./layout.css";
    composes: subtle-shadow from "./effect.css";
  }
  ```
