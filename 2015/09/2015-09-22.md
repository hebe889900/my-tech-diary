* Abusing the null transform hack -> too many layers are created -> longer composition time
* It's not a silver bullet

#### What does this hack do

* Switches on the **hardware compositing mode** if possible
* Creates a new layer with its own backing surface

#### Why it improves the performance

* It will let the GPU help the browser to do the rendering, leaving some leisure time for the CPU
* If you are doing animation, and all you do is moving layers or changing their opacity, GPU can handle these things directly.

#### Backing surfaces

* Layers != backing surfaces
* Backing surfaces are where layers are drawn. They are essentially **textures** that will be uploaded to and composited by the GPU
* When Chrome thinks a layer need its own backing surface
  * The layer has **3D or perspective transform** CSS properties
  * The layer is used by `<video>` using accelerated video decoding
  * The layer is used by `<canvas>` with 3D context/accelerated 2D context
  * The layer is used for a **composited plugin**(e.g. Flash/Silverlight)
  * The layer **uses accelerated CSS filters**
  * The layer has a **descendant** that is a compositing layer
  * The layer has a **sibling with a lower z-index** which has a compositing layer
    * These two rules means the layer is rendered **on top of a composited layer**
* Compositing
  * Draw the uploaded textures in turn to form the final picture

#### Why abusing this can be dangerous

* These textures cost memory. Some devices, like mobile devices, **don't have that much memory**.
* Not all devices are quick to **transfer the textures** from CPU to GPU for compositing
