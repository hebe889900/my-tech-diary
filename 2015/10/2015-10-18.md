This is quite biased, but still it's a fun read.

* What is a reference
  * It must be initialized when declared
  * It can't be reseated(point to another object)
  * You can't take the address of it. You can only take the address of the object that it points to
  * References can't point to `NULL`, so you can't have a "sentinel reference"
* Why does it exist
  * Operator overloading(returning references)
* When to use it
  * You are sure that you won't need null pointers, pointer arithmetics or reseating
  * You can't have array of references, or have it stored in container classes
  * If you are making class/structs with member references, you have to make sure you won't need default constructor. They must be initialized in member initializers.
