### [Is the web platform getting too big?](https://www.nczonline.net/blog/2015/09/is-the-web-platform-getting-too-big/)

* The stagnation of IE6 actually gave developers time to absorb all the innovations emerging in the browser war
* We need a single source of truth of the platform

## Security

### [Deprecating the RC4 Cipher](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/09/11/deprecating-the-rc4-cipher/)

* It was widely used by HTTPS servers because it's fast and immune to BEAST
* RFC 7465 forbids the use of RC4 in TLS
* There are new ciphers that are fast and immune to BEAST now, e.g. AES-GCM
* FF36(2015 Feb.) started to make RC4 a fallback-only cipher
* FF38(2015 May.) Nightly/Dev Edition only enable RC4 for a small whitelist
* Now it's only used in 0.08% of TLS transactions in FF
* FF44 will disable RC4 by default
* Operators can still provide RC4 for e.g. IE6, but as long as the server has a more secure cipher, FF will use that instead

### [Ending support for the RC4 cipher in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer 11](http://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/09/01/ending-support-for-the-rc4-cipher-in-microsoft-edge-and-internet-explorer-11/)

* Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer 11 only utilize RC4 during a fallback from TLS 1.2 or 1.1 to TLS 1.0.
* A fallback to TLS 1.0 with RC4 is most often the result of an innocent error, but this is **indistinguishable from a man-in-the-middle attack**
