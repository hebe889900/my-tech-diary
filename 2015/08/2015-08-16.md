## Resume

1. Delete the require cache so the live-reloading on JSON files can work properly

  ```javascript
  delete require.cache[require.resolve('./resume.json')];
  delete require.cache[require.resolve(localePath)];
  ```
2. Use gulp-live-server to replace gulp-livereload. Struggled with the server notification for about an hour, and finally I realized I don't need to notify the server after running tasks when **source file changes**, instead I should do so when **destination files change**.

  This is what I've tried:

  ```javascript
  gulp.watch('./src/**/*.less', ['less-debug']).on('change', function() {
    server.notify.apply(server, arguments);
  });
  ```
  But in this case the event object would contain info about the source file changes, and notifying the server about that is just meaningless. The right way to go is:

  ```javascript
  gulp.watch('./dist/**/*', function() {
    server.notify.apply(server, arguments);
  });
  ```
