### [C++11 STL containers and thread safety](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12931787/c11-stl-containers-and-thread-safety)

Spec 23.2.2:

> Implementations are required to avoid data races when the contents of the contained object in different elements in the same sequence, excepting vector<bool>, are modified concurrently.

* Simultaneous reads of the same object are OK
* Simultaneous read/writes of different objects are OK
* Ohter operations, e.g. simultaneous writes on the same object, needs custom synchronization(like critical sections)

### `stack`, `queue`, `deque`, Containers

Note the definition:

```cpp
template<
    class T,
    class Container = std::deque<T>
> class stack;

template<
    class T,
    class Container = std::deque<T>
> class queue;
```

So `stack` and `queue` are container adapters, they are wrappers to the underlying container. They both need the container to satisfy the concept [`SequenceContainer`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/SequenceContainer), the difference is that they additionally need different interfaces.

Stack needs:

* `back()`
* `push_back()`
* `pop_back()`

Candidates are `std::vector`, `std::deque` and `std::list`.

Queue needs

* `back()`
* `front()`
* `push_back()`
* `pop_front()`

Candidates are `std::deque` and `std::list`

Usually `deque`s are implmemented with a sequence of individually allocated fixed-size arrays(not contiguously as a whole, unlike `vector`s). Therefore its expansion is cheaper than `vector` because there's no need for copying.

### C++11 v.s. Boost

* range-based for
* Lambda
* `static_assert`
* rvalues
* regex
* list-initialization
* threads
* smart pointers
* bind
* `type_traits`
* `constexpr`
* `decltype`

## OS

### `malloc`

Need to

1. Get more virtual address space from the kernel, if needed
2. Find enough contiguous space to return

### Producerâ€“consumer problem

The solution for the producer is to either go to **sleep or discard** data if the buffer is full. The next time the consumer removes an item from the buffer, it **notifies** the producer, who starts to fill the buffer again. In the same way, the consumer can go to sleep if it finds the buffer to be empty. The next time the producer puts data into the buffer, it wakes up the sleeping consumer.

Using semaphores (`emptyCount` and `fillCount`) and critical sections for `putItemIntoBuffer()`(mutex).

### First readers-writers problem

#### Constriant

* When one's writing, others can't read/write
* Readers don't have to wait when others are reading
    * (Writers might starve)

#### Solution

```
Writer:
    # entry section
    lock resource
    # critical section
    write
    # exit section
    release resource

Reader:
    # entry section
    acquire mutex  # protect ++ from other readers
    readCount++
    if (readCount == 1)
        lock resource  # first reader lock out writers
    release mutex

    # critical section
    read

    # exit section
    acuqire mutex  # protect -- from other readerss
    readCount--
    if (readCount == 0)
        release resource  # last reader release for writers
    release mutex
```

### Second readers-writers problem

#### Constriant

* When one's writing, others can't read/write
* When a writer is waiting, don't add more readers
    * (Readers might starve)

#### Solution

```
Writer:
    # entry section
    acquire wmutex  # protect ++ from other writers
    writeCount++
    if (writeCount == 1)
        acquire readTry  # first writer locks out readers
    release wmutex

    # critical section
    # you can be sure there will be no readers now
    require resource  # locks out other writers
    write
    release resource

    # exit section
    acuqire wmutex  # protect -- from other readerss
    writeCount--
    if (writeCount == 0)
        release readTry  # last writer release for readers
    release wmutex

Reader:
    # entry section
    acquire rentry # protect readTry aquisition
    acquire readTry  # coordinating with writers to satisfy writer preference
    acquire rmutex  # protect ++ from other readers
    readCount++
    if (readCount == 1)
        lock resource  # first reader lock for writers
    release rmutex  # release for other readers
    release readTry
    release rentry

    # critical section
    read

    # exit section
    acuqire rmutex  # protect -- from other readerss
    readCount--
    if (readCount == 0)
        release resource  # last reader release for writers
    release rmutex
```

### Third readers-writers problem

* When one's writing, others can't read/write
* No one should starve

#### Solution

```
Writer:
    acquire rentry
    acquire wmutex
    write
    release rentry
    release wmutex

Reader:
    # entry section
    acquire rentry # protect entry
    acquire rmutex  # protect ++ from other readers
    readCount++
    if (readCount == 1)
        lock resource  # first reader lock for writers
    release rmutex  # release for other readers
    release rentry

    # critical section
    read

    # exit section
    acuqire rmutex  # protect -- from other readerss
    readCount--
    if (readCount == 0)
        release resource  # last reader release for writers
    release rmutex
```

## Networking

### Key features that set TCP apart from UDP

* **Ordered** data transfer
* **Retransmission** of lost packets
* **Error-free** data transfer
* **Flow control**
* **Congestion control**

### What are the key differences to HTTP/1.x?

At a high level, HTTP/2:

* is **binary**, instead of textual
* is fully **multiplexed**, instead of ordered and blocking(interleaved fragments!)
* can therefore use one connection for parallelism
* uses **header compression** to reduce overhead
* allows servers to **push** responses proactively into client caches

### `TIME_WAIT`

* After the TCP connection is closed, it will be kept around so that any delayed packets can be matched to the connection and handled appropriately.
* Huge amount of `TIME_WAIT` means you've got a lot of short-lived connections

### HTTP Status code

### Informational 1xx

* 100 Continue
* 101 Switching Protocols

### Success 2xx

* **200 OK**
* 201 Created
* 202 Accepted
* 203 Non-Authoritative Information

### Redirect 3xx

* 300 Multiple Choices
* **301 Moved Permanently**
* **302 Found**
* 303 See Other
* **304 Not Modified**
* 305 Use Proxy
* 307 Temporary Redirect

### Client Error 4xx

* 400 Bad Request
* 401 Unauthorized
* 402 Payment Required
* **403 Forbidden**
* **404 Not Found**
* 405 Method Not Allowed
* 406 Not Acceptable
