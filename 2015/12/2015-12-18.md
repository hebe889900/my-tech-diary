## Node Interactive

### [Lessons Learned: Extending Node.js with Another JavaScript Engine -](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbc3SwMDWf0)

* Windows 10 IoT running on Rasberry Pi 2 and MinnowBoard Max
* Node only support ARMv7 right now, but Windows 10 IoT runs on ARM Thumb-2
* DEMO: debugging Node.js code deployed on a Rasberry Pi 2 running Windows 10 IoT with VS

#### Chanllenges

* Chakra's release schedule is tied to the official Windows releases, so they decided to open source it so that it can move fast along with Node.js
* The old debugging API had hard tie-ins to the Windows platform. The new modern diagnostic API is designed to be interoperable across tools and runtimes
  * DEMO: Use VSCode to debug with the modern diagnostic API
* Working with the community and the TSC to optimize for real-world patterns
* Working on compatibility for packages(IoT packages at first), NaN support, participate/contribute in TSC/community to address compatibility across multiple engine
* Provide APIs to constrain resource utilization and an easy-to-port interpreter, help Node.js to grow in the device boom
* [This](https://github.com/Microsoft/node-v0.12/issues/13) will be haulted and  they will submit another PR for ChakraCore instead.

#### Roadmap

* Open source ChakraCore after holidays
* Submit PR to Node.js mainline
* Working with TSC/community to see how they can help grow Node.js
* Complete Modern Diagnostic API
* Cross platform support
