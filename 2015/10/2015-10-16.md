## CSS

For images that's too small to stretch to fit the screen in desktop, but too big to go full width in mobile. Assuming its legible width is 200px:

```css
/* mobile first: 100%  width */
.image {
  max-width: 100%
  height: auto;
}

/* on big screen, shouldn't stretch*/
@media (min-width: 200px) {
  .image {
    max-width: 200px;
  }
}
```

An important principle: make media query break points for the sake of the content, not for different screen sizes.
