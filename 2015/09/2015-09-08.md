## React & Flux

### [Hacker Way: Rethinking Web App Development at Facebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYkdrAPrdcw)

#### Introduction

* After the original author leaves, it's hard for anyone to make a change to the code base -- one small change could crash the whole thing.
* But we need to move fast

#### Flux

* Multiple model-view mapping makes it hard to debug(how do you discover an infinite loop between the model and the view?)
* Single direction data flow(store->view) to avoid too much mapping
* No more action will be applied until the last action is applied to the dispatcher->store->view

#### Case Study: Chat

* Keep multiple views in sync: chat tab, unseen count in the message bar, main message view
  * The code quickly gets unreadable: increment, check if focused, decrement
* Bug: unseen count can't be synchronized properly. Fixed edge cases again and again but it kept coming back, and the code base was very fragile.
* Solution
  * **Move update logic inside each view component**. Don't let the handler update them by itself.
  * Maintain explicit data(unseen list) instead of derived data(unseen count)
  * Separate data from the view state
  * Avoid cascading effects by preventing nested updates
    * Don't allow any more update until you finish the action
  * Make everything go through one single flow

#### Improvements

* Data consistency
* Easier to pinpoint root of a bug
  * Modules instead of handlers
* Easier to do unit test
  * State A -> input -> state B

#### Rendering

* Only rerender what's necessary
* Need a rendering library for this to make it maintainable: react

#### React

* Data changing over time is the root of all evil
* It's very hard to keep track of updates imperatively
* Back in the 90s: render it like a static snapshot
  * Do it the RESTful way(referentially transparent functions)
  * Describe UI at any point in time
  * Trivial to predict for a given input
  * Easy to test(making actions and making assertion on states)
* It's the fault of **stateful UI**. They are not designed for frequent rerendering of the whole thing. It's the same for DOM, iOS, etc.
* React: computation(diff) done on the virtual DOM
* Declarative IR -> Compute DOM operations(or native operations, etc.) like you compute OpenGL operations in game engines

#### Use case: Facebook -> Instagram

* Extract React from PHP and Facebook's architecture and move it into Instagram's Django stack running on EC2

#### Q&A

* Routing
  * Instagram uses backbone router.
  * Routes are a kind of states.
* Compared to Angular:
  * Angular makes you not to model your application in terms functions and objects but in terms of directives and controllers, etc.
  * Data binding needs good abstraction.
  * It's faster to iterate using react.
* Compared to jQuery & AJAX:
  * Stores manages the network operations, you can use jQuery for that
  * With React you only need to think about one state - the current state. You just describe your view at a point in time declaratively.
