## Vue

### vue-router

The documentation is really vague, and you can't serach for keywords in it(since it's a gitbook, duh...although Google can do the job, well, sort of).

* [`params` only makes sense with `name`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/issues/239), and yes, it's route parameter, not some `state` object, you can't just pass the params implicitly without specifying them in the route(with things like `:param`)...
* Pass properties to views by `<router-view v-bind:someProp="data"></router-view>`([doc](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-router/en/view.html)). This requires all the components to have the same properties.
* Dynamic components can be done with `<component :is="$route.params.componentName"></component>`(if you don't want to map them yourselves)
* You can't have multiple routers on the same path, it's simple: you only have one `location` and one `history` in a page, so how can you have multiple routers modifying them without interfering with each other? It's pretty hard to reason about, if you just consider how the mapping should work.
