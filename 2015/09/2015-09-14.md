## Data Visualization

### [React.js Conf 2015 - Scalable Data Visualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ii1lEkIv1s)

#### How to scale

* Condensing your data into **a smaller set of visual elements**
* Syncing between high-level views, the client and the server
* Keep the computation close to the raw data(flux-like architecture)
  * Replace dispatcher with XHR/WebSocket
  * Replace store with a stateful server
* Scalable aggregation
  * Binning: 1d Histogram/2d heat map, count by groups
  * Estimate quantiles when streaming
  * Aggregate by chunks, sending results periodically(streaming)

#### React

* In `componentDidMount`

  ```
  websocket.onmessage = (function(message) {
    this.setState({histogram: hist(message.data)});
  }).bind(this);
  ```
* Let React render your updates

#### D3

* Use D3 to calculate the data-dependent sizes and positions
* There are only three parts in D3 that will conflict with React(because it need to own the DOM): selections, transitions, and `d3.behavior`(drag, zoom)
* Use D3 to calculate the (SVG) attributes of your React component, and use D3 to generate your components(properties like path, labels, etc.)

#### Choosing the render target(Canvas v.s. SVG)

* SVG maxes out way sooner than canvas because it's stateful and canvas is not
* Factors
  * Number of visual elements
  * Animation
  * Level of interactivity
  * Browser support
* SVG has CSS and DOM events. Can be easily combined with React. 
  * Can handle <1000 visual elements
* Canvas
  * Handles 2d elements in continuous space well
  * >1000 visual elements

## Git

### [Tracking branches v.s. remote tracking branches](http://www.gitguys.com/topics/tracking-branches-and-remote-tracking-branches/)

* `git merge` only updates tracking branches, `git fetch` only updates remote tracking branches
* Tracking branches
  * Get data via `git clone`, `git pull` and `git merge`
  * **Can be modified** by the local user
* Remote tracking branches
  * Get data via `git clone`, `git pull` and `git fetch`
  * Local users **can't modify remote tracking branches**!

#### What does `git clone url` do

1. Create a new remote tracking branch `origin/master`(read-only to the user)
2. Copies the remote repository from the URL to the new remote tracking branch `origin/master`
3. Create a tracking branch called `master`
4. Set the `master` tracking branch pointer to point to the same commit as the remote tracking branch `origin/master`'s pointer

#### What does `git push` do

1. Publish the commit from the local tracking branch `master` to the remote repository
2. Update the remote tracking branch with the new commit, and point the pointer of the remote tracking branch `origin/master` to the updated new commit

#### What does `git fetch origin` do

1. Download the latest commits from the remote repository `origin`(all branches), and copy commits from the `master` branch in the remote repository to the remote tracking branch `origin/master`
2. At this point, the tracking branch `master` still points to the old commit

#### What does `git merge origin/master` do

* Merge commits from the remote tracking branch `origin/master` to the tracking branch `master`

#### What does `git pull` do

* Fetch + merge, but it fetches and merge branches by the tracking relationship you set up before(not by hand)
