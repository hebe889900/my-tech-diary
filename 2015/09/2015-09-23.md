* IP address allocation and routing are largely controlled by China Telecom and China Unicom
* Chinese Internet giants rarely own their IP address aloocations, or use BGP to control routing
* **Bottlenecks** in interconnection points between regional networks and ISPs. It's sometimes even faster if you route traffic outside the country and then back in!(this "technique" is known as *networking tromboning*)
* You usually need many geographically distributed data centers across the country for good performance(that's why it is easier for those Chinese Internet giants to build their own cloud services LOL)
* Non-Chinese providers who provide services in mainland China usually use networking tromboning

2. Writing scripts
3. Zip it into a .xpi. A great way to automate this process is `gulp-zip`
