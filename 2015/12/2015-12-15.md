### Vue

#### Update a subtree in vue

Each tree should have a `path` property.

The root:

```html
<tree :path="[]"></tree>
```

The children:

```html
<tree :path="path.concat($index)" v-for="tree in data.children"></tree>
```

When you need to update the subtree, dispatch an event

```javascript
this.$dispatch('event-name', this.path, this.data);
```

The store will find the root of this subtree by iterating over `path`:

```javascript
let root = path.reduce((current, index) => current.children[index], treeRoot);
// update root with Vue.set
```

### D3

`.html()` in d3 is slower than `.innerHTML` when you don't need to patch up a bunch of strings.

### redux in Rx

From [Conference Day 2 | Reactive 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cIEtC-V2XE&feature=youtu.be&t=8h48m48s)

```javascript
function store(actions$) {
  return makeReducerStream(actions$)
    .scan((state, reducer) => reducer(state, initialState))
    .shareReplay(1)
}
```
