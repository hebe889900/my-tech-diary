### [An update on Object.observe](https://esdiscuss.org/topic/an-update-on-object-observe)

Personally I don't want this to go away because I do believe `O.o` is helpful for data-binding frameworks. And I believe it's not widely used only because it doesn't have good cross-platform support(so ES5 getters/setters, albeit less powerful, are a much popular choice), not because it's useless.

For example, overriding getters/setters can only detect changes on *existing properties* for an object, but can not detect changes like *adding or deleting* properties. Vue uses things like `Vue.set` for that, but it's not very pretty IMHO. Surely proxies can help but it's nowhere near getting a good support anytime soon(can't even have a polyfill). `O.o` is much simpler than proxies, already in stage 2, and HAS implementations(or equivalents like `Object.prototype.watch` in FF) now. So I do hope they can keep it in ES7.
