### [select / poll / epoll: practical difference for system architects](http://www.ulduzsoft.com/2014/01/select-poll-epoll-practical-difference-for-system-architects/)

#### select

* Been around for a long time(since 1983)
* Not in the first POSIX spec since by then there was no such thing as non-blocking I/O
* **Usage**: fill up some `fd_set` with descriptors and events and call `select()` with them

  ```cpp
  struct fd_set fds_in, fds_out;
  FD_ZERO(&fds_in);  FD_ZERO(&fds_out);

  int largest_fd = socks[0];
  // setup event monitor, find the largest fd
  for (size_t i = 0; i < NUM_FDS_IN; ++i) {
    if (socks_in[i] > 0)
      FD_SET(socks_in[i], &fds_in);  // add it to the wait list
    if (socks_in[i] > largest_fd)
      largest_fd = socks_in[i];
  }

  for (size_t i = 0; i < NUM_FDS_OUT; ++i) {
    if (socks_out[i] > 0)
      FD_SET(socks_out[i], &fds_out);  // add it to the wait list
    if (socks_out[i] > largest_fd)
      largest_fd = socks_out[i];
  }

  // timeout
  struct timeval tv;
  tv.tv_sec = 10;
  tv.tv_usec = 0;

  // call the select
  int ret = select(largest_fd + 1, &fds_in, &fds_out, NULL, &tv);
   
  // Check if select actually succeed
  if ( ret == -1 ) {
    // report error and abort
  } else if ( ret == 0 ) {
    // timeout; no event detected
  } else {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < NUM_FDS_IN; ++i) {
      if (FD_ISSET(socks_in[i], &fds_in)) {
        // input event on socks_in[i]
        // ...
        close (sockes_in[i]);
        sockes_in[i] = 0;  // reset later
      }
    }
    for (size_t i = 0; i < NUM_FDS_OUT; ++i) {
      if (FD_ISSET(socks_out[i], &fds_out)) {
        // output event on socks_out[i]
        // ...
        close(sockes_out[i]);
        sockes_out[i] = 0;  // reset later
      }
    }
  }

  // then you need to setup all the events again...ugh!
  ```
* **Flaws**
  * Can't **reuse** `fd_set` that you pass into it, `select` will overwrite it every single time, so you need to refill it every time you call `select`. Say the number of connections you need to watch for is N, **this operation is O(N)!** This means you need to do this O(N) thing after every event occurrence
  * When it returns, it doesn't tell you which descriptor is the on that has its event invoked. you need to **manually** check every descriptor with `FD_ISSET`. Say the number of connections you need to watch for is N, **this operation is O(N)!**
  * Number of descriptors is limited
  * Not suited for **multi-threaded** environments -- "If a file descriptor being monitored by `select()` is closed in another thread, the result is **unspecified**"(WTF?!)
  * It periodically checks the descriptors(typically scanning a bit vector), which wastes CPU cycles
* **Why it's still used**
  * Portability - it's been around everywhere
  * Handle timeouts within one **ns** precision(`poll` and `epoll` can only handle one **ms**)
* **Note**
  * Disk files are **always ready to read** (but the read might return 0 bytes if you're already at the end of the file), so you can't use `select()` on a disk file to find out when new data is added to the file

#### poll

* Appeared in 1986, introduced in Linux since 1997(2.1.23)
* Why it's "better"
  * `select()` can't handle many descriptors because its implementation (usually) uses fixed-size bitmasks, but `poll()` (usually) uses linked list(wait queue) so it can handle **much more descriptors**
  * `poll()` can reuse the descriptors(but you need to set `fd.revents = 0`)
  * Can monitor more events than `select()`
* **Usage**: fill some `struct pollfd` and call `poll()` with them

  ```cpp
  // fill some fds
  struct pollfd fds[NUM_FDS];
  for (size_t i = 0; i < NUM_FDS; ++i) {
    fds[i].fd = socks[i];
    fds[i].events = events[i];  /* event interested in */
  }
   
  // Timeout in 10s
  int ret = poll(&fds, NUM_FDS, 10000);

  // Check if poll actually succeed
  if ( ret == -1 ) {
    // report error and abort
  } else if ( ret == 0 ) {
    // timeout; no event detected
  } else {
    // If we detect the event, zero it out so we can **reuse** the structure
    for (size_t i = 0; i < NUM_FDS; ++i) {
      if (fds[i].revents & events[i]) {  /* event actually happened */
        fds[i].revents = 0;
        // event fired on socks[i]
      }
    }
  }

  // Ok, then the next time you setup things,
  // you only have to reset the used fd!
  ```
* **Flaws**
  * `poll()` can only has ms-precision, while `select()` has ns
  * Not in Windows older than Vista, but you can do this

    ```cpp
    #if defined (WIN32)
    static inline int poll( struct pollfd *pfd, int nfds, int timeout) { return WSAPoll ( pfd, nfds, timeout ); }
    #endif
    ```
  * You still need to manually check each descriptor for events, which is still O(N)
  * Still has unspecified behavior for multithreaded environment(e.g. close a monitored socket)
* Note
  * If it's just a choice between `poll()` and `select()`, **only** use `select()` instead of `poll()` when
    * You need to support systems that don't have `poll()`
    * You need ns-precision(which is rare)
  * But, most of the times `epoll()` is a better choice
