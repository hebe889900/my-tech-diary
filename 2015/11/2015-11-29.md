### [A tour of V8: Garbage Collection](http://jayconrod.com/posts/55/a-tour-of-v8-garbage-collection)

### Generational collection

* Most objects tend to **die young**
* **New-space**
  * Allocation is cheap(done with incrementing allocation pointer)
  * When the allocation pointer reaches the end of the new space, start **scavenge** GC(implementation of [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheney%27s_algorithm))
* **Old-space**
  * Objects that survive more than two GC in new-space will be moved here
  * GC'ed with **mark-sweep/mark-compact**, which is much less frequent
  * GC occurs when the amount of memory moved to old-space reach a threashold(changes over time)

#### Scavenge

* Divide the new-space into from-space and to-space
* Allocate memory in to-space(`Code` are always allocated in old-space though)
* When the to-space fills up, swap to-space and from-space, move live objects to to-space or to old-space, leaving dead objects behind
* Benefits: compacation can be done, improving cache locality, keep allocation fast and simple
* Start from the root, copy them all to the to-space. Then follow their internal pointers and copy the objects that are pointed to to-space(essentially **BFS**).
