### [A tour of V8: Garbage Collection](http://jayconrod.com/posts/55/a-tour-of-v8-garbage-collection)

#### Basics

* In theory, An object is **live** if it is pointed to by a root object or another live object
* Approximation: an object is live if it is **reachable** through some chain of pointers from an object which is **live by definition**.
* **Root**: pointed to directly by V8, or the web browser.
  * Objects pointed to by local variables(the stack is scannedfor roots)
  * Objects pointed to by global objects
  * DOM elements

#### Spaces

* **New-space**
  * Small, independent, garbage collected quickly.
  * Most objects are **allocated** here.
* **Old-pointer-space**
  * Most **objects with pointers** lives here
  * They came here after living in the new-space for a while.
* **Old-data-space**
  * **Objects without pointers**(e.g. strings, boxed numbers, arrays of unboxed doubles)
  * They came here after living in the new-space for a while.
* **Large-object-space**
  * Objects **larger than the size limits** of other spaces
  * Each object has its own `mmap`'d memory
  * **Never moved by the garbage collector**
* **Code space**
  * `Code` objects with **JITed instructions**
  * Has executable memory
* **Cell-space**, **property-cell-space** and **map-space**
  * `Cells`, `PropertyCells`, and `Maps`
  * Each cell is of the **same size**
  * Has **constraints** on what they can point to to simplify collection

#### Pages

* Spaces consist of pages
* A `Page` is a contiguous chunck of memory(allocated with `mmap` or whatever)
* 1MB in size, 1MB aligned(except large-object-space)
* Conatins
  * Objects
  * Header(flags, metadata)
  * Marking bitmap(liveness)
* Each page has a **slots buffer** associated with it, allocated in separate memory
  * Forms **remembered set** -- a list of objects which may **point to objects stored in this page**
