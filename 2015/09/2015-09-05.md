## Angular

### [Build Your own Simplified AngularJS in 200 Lines of JavaScript](http://blog.mgechev.com/2015/03/09/build-learn-your-own-light-lightweight-angularjs/)

#### Components

* Provider(singleton)
  * Register components (directives, services and controllers)
  * Resolve components' dependencies
  * Initialize components
* DOMCompiler(singleton)
  * Traverse the DOM tree
  * Finds registered directives added as attributes
  * Invoke the logic associated with them
  * Manages the scope
* Scope
  * Watches expressions
  * Evaluates all watched expressions on each `$digest` loop, until stable
  * Invokes all the observers, which are associated with the watched expression

#### Provider

* Register: maintain a name-function map
* Service, controller, directives are registered with special suffixes
* Keep a smaller cache. Cache `$rootScope` by default.
* Use regex to find dependencies in `fn.toString()`
* Invoke providers with resolved local dependencies
* The global dependencies are all the components we register using `factory`, `service`, `filter`
* `$scope` and `$delegate` are local dependencies, specific for given component
* Use **topological sort** to handle circular dependency and find the order to resolve dependencies

#### DOMCompiler

* Find all directives associated with an element, check if they need a new scope(`{scope: true}`, if they do, **create a new scope that inherits from the current scope**). Then do it for all its children(thus DFS)
* Invokes the logic of all directives associated with `el`, then invokes more logic **recursively** on each children of `el`

#### Scope

* `$digest` loop runs over all watched expressions, check if their values have changed, and invoke the listeners
* `$watch(expr, fn)` will invoke `fn` whenver `expr` change
* `$eval(expr)` evaluates the express **in the current scope**
* `$digest()` runs the dirty-checking loop. It loop through all the `$$watchers`, and run the watcher listener when the express changes until it's no longer dirty
  * We need to `$digest()` until it's stable(for inner expressions)
  * Everytime `last` is accessed, do the dirty checking
* For each watcher, maintain the last-value by cloning `$eval(expr)`
* `exp.call(this)` or `eval(expr)`

#### Directives

* `ng-bind`
  * `scope: false`
  * no scope, use `innerHTML`
* `ng-model`
  * Listen for `keyup`
* `ng-controller`
  * `scope: true`
  * Forward Provider
  * Need to call `$digest` for updates
* `ng-click`
  * `$eval`(so there will be updates on the website) and `$digest()`
