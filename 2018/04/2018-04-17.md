# Concept Time: Restful API 
REST:
**REpresentational State Transfer** (**REST**)

Resource:
All noun

REpresentational:
Resources are presented in different ways. (XML/JSON/BSON)

State Transfer:
Transfer the state of the resources (CRUD)

Stateless:
Each request has all the information to process the request
No client state at server
Client side should maintain client site's state
/myprofile vs /myprofile/zhangsan

Principle:
1. A url is identify to one resource
2. Urls should include nouns, not verbs
3. Use HTTP Verbs to operate the actions on the collections and elements. (GET, POST(Create), PUT(Update), DELETE)
4. Use plural nouns for consistency
5. Shouldn't use two ids to get one recources
	Bad magazines/1234/articals/5678
	Good /articals/5678
6. Add version for different version of API
7. Specity optional field
	magazines/1234?fields=magazine_title,subtitle,date
