## Koa

Wrote a [simple server](https://github.com/joyeecheung/cross-domain-with-koa/blob/master/app.js) for experimenting with various domain-crossing techniques.

A few notes:

1. Middlewares look like this:

  ```javascript
  function *middlware(next) {
    // do something that needs the request/response
    yield next;
    // do the cleanup/logging, etc.
  }
  ```
2. You don't need to specifically send the response. Just set `this.body`. Also you can set the `Content-Type` by setting `this.type`(a simple `json` would do if you want to send JSON. Koa will fill the detailed value for you).
3. `koa-route` is very weak, so it's much better to use `koa-router`. This supports prefixes, router nesting, and multiple middlewares for a single route.
