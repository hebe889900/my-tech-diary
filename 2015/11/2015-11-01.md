### Vue/Flux

Been playing with it and start to use it to refactor our dashboard. It's really well-maintained and easy to use.

The [shared store pattern](http://vuejs.org/guide/application.html#State_Management) combined with some flux-like architecture is working quite well :) I still keep jQuery for `Deferred`(could be replaced with some alternative later though), and Bootstrap for some tricky components like responsive navbars, but I think most of the code can get rid of these dependencies. For data visualization, D3 and lo-dash are still gonna stay.

After giving it some thought, I decided to use [facebook/flux](https://github.com/facebook/flux) for the flux implementation. Pure FR style(redux) is not suitable for us because we have large datasets and it just seems wired with Vue's data-binding model. Implementations like reflux don't handle circular dependencies really well, which could be a problem for us. So I go with the no-brainer :)
