### What I'm thinking when I'm writing C/C++

#### If I'm writing C

* I'll use raw pointers and arrays
* I'll implement a lot of containers and algorithms
* I'll use function pointers
* I'll frequently manage the memory myself
* I'll use `malloc` and free and `realloc` and break type safety
* I'll use macros to do metaprogramming and generic programming, albeit a limited one
* I'll use `struct`s like they are aggregates
* When I encounter something wrong, I'll return an error code
* When I need to return a large amount of data, I pass a pointer to a function
* I usually thinks procedure-oriented
* I uses pointers for I/O
* I uses explicit namespaces(prefix the variables)
* In my for-loop usually are indices and pointers

#### If I'm writing C++

* I'll use smart pointers, references, iterators and vectors
* I'll use STL
* I'll use functors, or the more powerful lambda functions
* I'll delegate tons of memory management works to RAII and smart pointers
* I'll use new and delete and doRAII with constructors and destructors
* I'll use templates, concepts, `constexpr` to do metaprogramming and generic programming, which is much more powerful
* I'll have classes, and I'll have encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance
* When I encounter something wrong, I'll throw an exception
* When I need to return a large amount of data, I use move semantics, or rely on RVO
* I can think object-oriented, or functional, or generic, etc.
* I use streams for I/O
* I use the real namespace
* In my for-loop, I use `auto` :)

### When should `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `const_cast` and `reinterpret_cast` be used?

* Use `dynamic_cast` for converting pointers/references within an inheritance hierarchy.
* Use `static_cast` for ordinary type conversions(when it is reasonable e.g. float to int).
* Use `reinterpret_cast` for low-level reinterpreting of bit patterns. Use with extreme caution.
* Use `const_cast` for casting away const/volatile. Avoid this unless you are stuck using a const-incorrect API.

### TCP congestion control

1. Slow start: power of 2
2. Congestion avoidance: when a packet loss happened
  * Tahoe
    * Halve the slow start threshold
    * Set congestion window to 1MSS
    * Enter slow start
  * Reno
    * Halve the slow start threshold(like Tahoe)
    * Set congestion window to half of the previous slow start threshold(unlike Tahoe)
    * Enter fast recovery(retransmit, if it is lost again, then go back to slow start)
3. When the ACK times out, Reno is the same as Tahoe

### [Bringing componentization to the web: An overview of Web Components](http://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/07/14/bringing-componentization-to-the-web-an-overview-of-web-components/)

Web Components consists of:

* Custom Elements
* HTML Templates
* Shadow DOM
* HTML Imports

#### CSS style isolation

* Shadow document and boundaries
  * Two ways to break the boundaries:
    1. Parts styling: create **custom pseudo elements** to expose to the outside world(so they can style them)
    2. Custom properties: inherited variables(which cross the boundaries), useful for theming
* Selector isolation
  * `@media`
  * `@page`
  * `@supports`
  * `@document`(proposal)
* [CSS scoping](CSS Custom Properties for Cascading Variables Module Level 1): `@scope`
  * Also intended to be used with [the DOM](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping/#scope)
  * One-way: selectors in that `@scope` can't access elements in the outside world, but selectors outside that `@scope` can select inside the `@scope`
    * Which means you need to be very careful when using selectors that are not scoped
* [CSS Containment](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-containment/)
  * More about layout isolation
  * Blocks some inheritance
  * Promises containment with `contain`
  * Allow browsers to optimize layout and rendering: dirty layout in the subtree doesn't affect the outside world, so only that sub-tree needs to be updated

#### JavaScript isolation

* Lexical scopes in JS
* Workers
  * Clean & fresh global object, with security boundaries
* The good old `<iframe>`
  * Risks: breaching isolation boundaries with things like `contentWindow`(Same-origin policy helps though)
  * `<iframe sandbox>`
    * Protect the host from unwanted scripting, popups, navigation, etc.
  * Style isolation creates a significant *seam*, can be sovled with `<iframe seamless>`
  * No deep integration e.g. for events
  * Each iframe comes with a global object, which is expensive
  * No reuse of the host element's content model
  * `seamless` is not that good
  * In general, the question of what to style should belong to the component
  * No good APIs and lifecycle management

#### Historical proposals

* [HTML Components](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-HTMLComponents)(1998) by M$, started in IE5.5, obsoleted in IE10
* [XBL](http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/NOTE-xbl-20010223/)(2001) AND [XBL2](http://www.w3.org/TR/xbl/)(2007) by Mozilla, companion to XUL
* Web Components by Google

#### First generation

* Custom elements
  * Not about boundary, but about attaching APIs
  * `is` attribute to tell the browser to attach APIs to a normal element
* Shadow DOM
  * Imperative API for connecting subtrees to the host
  * Reuse the host element's content model with `<slot>`, event target fixup, and closed/open modes of operation
  * Great impact on many things like the focus model
  * Related to CSS Scoping
* `<template>`
  * inertness: don't trigger download/respond to user input
  * Declaratively create a disconnected element
  * Template stamping, data-binding, conveying the content of a shadow DOM, etc.
* Custom properties(CSS variables)

#### The next generation

* Declarative shadow DOM
  * About serialization
* Fully Isolated Components
  * About isolated global object and API
  * 3 different proposals, but pretty much aligned
* Accessibility primitives
  * `is` is for extending existing native elements because they carry **accessibility behaviors** that are not available to JS
  * We need accessibility extension points for real components(without `is`)
* Unified native control styling
  * Shadow DOM can be used to implement a unified control system
  * There are ideas in CSS, but lacks momentum
* CSS parts styling
  * **Expose** parts of the component for styling
  * Especially import for native controls
* Parser customization
  * Customize beyond open/close tags
