## Vue

* Use `keep-alive` on components to really *reuse* them
* `<route-view keep-alive></route-view>` to persist the state of each route component

### [Node.js at Netflix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p74282nDMX8)

#### Past

* Monolith Java server
* Slow builds, 40m to start, hard to do A/B test

#### Why Node

* Common language, easy to hire and train engineers
* Can move a lot more faster
* Module system

#### Present

* Netflix.com, SPA
* Restify, React, Falcor
* Isomorphic React and memory leak

#### What they learned

* Tune for the app, not the VM
* Find CPU bottleneck
* Common root of memory leak: shared global data
* Importance of insights: [restify#dtrace](http://restify.com/#dtrace)
* CI(spinnaker, jenkins)
  * The website team can push multiple times a week

#### Future

* 30+ people working on the website, acquisition and sign-up layer
* PaaS
* Data access layer
  * Originally(3+ years) a monolithic layer using groovy scripts to aggregate the RESTful API
  * Hard to debug, anyone deploying new scripts could affect the whole layer
  * Add a container layer built with Node.js at the front, offer isolation
* A new protocol called Reactive Socket(fully duplex, non-blocking, async, reactive streams)
  * Both the client and the server, all the way through the stack
* Currently need a sidecar(Prana, HTTP based) for the NetflixOSS and their cloud platform, considering building first-class clients when Node becomes important enough
* Currently they don't use Amazon ECS for service(just batch jobs), so they need some effort to build those front-end Node containers(also, single instance -> containers needs mind transitioning)

#### Q&A

* The protocol that their clients use are limited by the device's ability
* But on some devices, like TV using their SDK, they can use Reactive Socket because they can access TCP/UDP layer
  * But TV has a very long development cycle
* Consolidated logging, application flow logging
