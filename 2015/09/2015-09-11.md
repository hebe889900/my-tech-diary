#### Common cases

* Test for the common case first
  * e.g. one primitive property v.s. deep equal object
* Break up loops with multiple `if` conditions that contain an early exit, and do the cheap check first
  * Both O(n) so it will double the time if if doesn't fail, but this allows for a much earlier exit if it does fail

#### Abstraction

* Abstraction(nested function calls) doesn't necessarily slow you down, thanks to the JIT inlining
* You don't always need to bind `this`. This is important for library authors(only use `call` when you need to)
* Put the optimization killers(e.g. touching `arguments`, `try-catch`) into its own function
* Organize your preconditions so you don't do type checking in wrong places
* Small functions can be inlined better

#### Built-ins

* Why don't use built-ins?
  * Browser consistency(can't be avoided with a shim)
  * Native implementations usually don't test for common cases, and they can't be optimized properly
* When you can't get your code optimized because you want to use something like `for-in`, use `Object.keys()` to do a shim
* `Array.isArray()` is fast.
* ES6 `Set` is great(good for implementation of caches!)
* Be careful that there might be some bad polyfills wrecks your native methods on the `prototype`

#### Functions

* Calling `function.toString()`(e.g. test for `this` reference) can cause a cost in some implementations(might need to do a little bytecode decompilation), so be careful(e.g. you can do a implementation check before you do this)
* Use `function.name` to determine if it's OK to save metadata on the functions
* Use metadata to avoid the cost caused by functional stuff(e.g. currying, partial applications, bindings, etc.)
* Use a bitmap in the metadata to map to the function you want

#### Others

* Profile first, then do benchmarks on bottlenecks
* Test `function.toString()` for patterns of non-native code
