## My thesis

So I finally decided what my Bachelor's thesis would be...A DSL designed for data visualization. Wrote the proposal(about 1K2 words) today.

Need to do some research on:

* Processing
* D3
* Elm
* Rx
* Compilers(duh)
* SVG API, SMIL
* [Vector Graphics Animation with Time-Varying Topology](http://www.dalboris.com/research/vac/)
* Other DSL for DV in the wild
