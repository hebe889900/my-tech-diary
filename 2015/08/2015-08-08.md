### [Differences between Just in Time compilation and On Stack Replacement](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9105505/differences-between-just-in-time-compilation-and-on-stack-replacement/9105846#9105846)

* JIT - Compiles native code at run time
* OSR - Switching between different implementations of the same function(e.g. unoptimized code/JITed code)

## C++

### [What do people mean when they say C++ has “undecidable grammar”?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/794015/what-do-people-mean-when-they-say-c-has-undecidable-grammar/794116#794116)

* C++'s template system is Turing complete
* Some apparently valid C++ programs can't be compiled because the compiler just can't decide if it is valid - remember the halting problem?
* C++ grammer is ambiguous and needs context, so it's impossible to separate syntax analysis from semantic analysis.
* Since in C++ semantic analysis is undecideable, so is syntax analysis.

### [Determining the Size of a Class Object](http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/size_of_class_object.html)

* Size of all non-static data members
  * Static data members won't be counted
* Order of data members
  * Padding(why padding? Because otherwise you need to do more memory access/modify cycles)
  * Most compilers won't reorder in the layout
* Byte alignment or byte padding
  * Before C++11(with `alignas` and `alignof`), you need to use complier extension to give them hints
* Size of its immediate base class
  * Size of base classes is included since the subclass object will have a base class object of its own
* The existence of virtual function(s)
  * On virtual table pointer for each virtual function, usually it's the same size as a normal pointer
  * Virtual table pointer will be common across the class hierarchy, so if you have a virtual function in your base class and another in your subclass, they will only add 1 pointer to your memory layout.
* Compiler being used
  * e.g. MSVC will add padding between base classes and subclasses, but gcc won't
* Mode of inheritance
  * Virtual inheritance will add a pointer to the object
  * The final class in the diamond problem solved with virtual inheritance will only have one virtual class pointer though.
