### [Introducing RAIL: A User-Centric Model For Performance](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/10/rail-user-centric-model-performance/)

#### Thresholds

[Jakob Nielsen’s work on response time limits](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/) shows that:

> 0.1 second is about the limit for having the user feel that **the system is reacting instantaneously**, meaning that no special feedback is necessary except to display the result.
> 1.0 second is about the limit for the user's **flow of thought to stay uninterrupted**, even though the user will notice the delay. Normally, no special feedback is necessary during delays of more than 0.1 but less than 1.0 second, but the user does lose the feeling of operating directly on the data.
> 10 seconds is about the limit for **keeping the user's attention focused on the dialogue**. For longer delays, users will want to perform other tasks while waiting for the computer to finish, so they should be given feedback indicating when the computer expects to be done. Feedback during the delay is especially important if the response time is likely to be highly variable, since users will then not know what to expect.

* **100ms** for **response** to user actions
* **1s** for a **task**(e.g. loading web pages, changing views) to complete
* **16ms**(60fps) for **motion**

#### R: Response

* Primary interaction: **tapping**
* Feedback in **< 100ms**
* Longer than that, then the user will start wondering if they really trigger that tap
* If the feedback is going to take longer than that, you need to put on some indicator

#### A: Animation

* Common cases
  * **Visual animation**(entrance, exit, tweened state changes, loading indicators)
  * **Scrolling**
  * **Dragging**
* Feedback in **< 16ms**(60fps)

#### I: Idle

* Common cases
  * Optimistic UI
  * Doing work before the user start to need it(but you predict they will)
  * Bootstrapping comments, initializing components, searching, sorting...
* Group them in about **50ms**, so when the user start to interact, you will likely to provide a timely feedback(in 100ms)

#### L: Load

* Keys
  * Give the user the first meaningful paint quickly
  * Once that's delivered, the app must remain responsive
* Deliver the first meaning full paint in **< 1s**
* Practices
  * Prioritizing the critical rendering path
  * Deferring subsequent non-enssential loads/lazy load on demand

#### Notes

* Mobile devices can be much smaller than your computer
* Look at the analytics to test the 90th percentile's experience
