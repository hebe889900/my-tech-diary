### [Six Tips for Chrome DevTools](https://css-tricks.com/six-tips-for-chrome-devtools/)

1. You can search for an element in the DOM inspector by CSS selectors!(in case you didn't notice)
2. The top-left flamechart-like button will take you to the Media Query Inspector! Click on the available media queries to see the effect, and right click to go to the source code!
3. You can copy responses in the network panel
4. "Copy as `cURL`" in the network panel can give you a corresponding `curl` command!
5. Inline hints in JS debugger
6. Filmstrip in the network pannel ([the way to turn it on](http://webperformance.io/devtools-filmstrip) is ridiculous...press SHIFT 6 times?! Is this some kind of treasure hunting game?)

## JS

### [RxJS](http://xgrommx.github.io/rx-book)

#### Intro

Observables fill the gap by being the ideal way to access asynchronous sequences of multiple items

|                              | Single return value | Mutiple return values            |
|------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| Pull/Synchronous/Interactive | Object              | Iterables (Array/Set/Map/Object) |
| Push/Asynchronous/Reactive   | Promise             | Observable                       |


#### Why not promises?

* Promises are more suitable for one-off aysnc operatinon. It is difficult to use promises to optimally compose **conditional asynchronous execution flows**.
* The Reactive Extensions for JavaScript **unifies** both the world of Promises, callbacks as well as evented data such as DOM Input, Web Workers, Web Sockets.
* This enables **rich composition**
* Use `flatMap` to ensure the order of the sequence is correct
* `subscribe` to start pulling
