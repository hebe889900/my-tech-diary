## SVG

* `text-decoration` is not inherited properly in IE.
* Found a weird bug where IE won't display `text-decoration` in some cases...haven't found the cause yet.
* Event delegation for SVG in jQuery 1.x doesn't work in IE.

## NPM

Don't know why but recently I've seen a lot of machines that doesn't give much logs when doing `npm install`, maybe npm changed its default loglevel? Anyway a simple way to get it back is to edit your `.npmrc` so that it contains this line

```
loglevel=http
```
