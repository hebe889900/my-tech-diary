### [V8 Performance from the Driver's Seat (Chrome Dev Summit 2015)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDFWIb0pi4U)

### TurboFan

* AST as *a sea of nodes*
* Scheduling freedom
* Designed to optimize ES2015 and beyond
* Use static type information(instead of type inference) to optimize asm.js and sooner WebAssembly

### Idle-time GC

* Blink scheduling API
* Tell V8 when it can GC without jank
* Especially when you background a tab(it's time to GC!)

### ES2015 support

Ugh...nothing interesting

### Svelte interpreter -- Ignition

* For mobile devices with limited memory
* Slower but saves memory(3x-4x with Ignition bytecode)
* Check [this](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JkRffrAmCRaP_nvj3_dB9feE7sN6ULDIzeH0HtoZATY/edit#slide=id.p) out

### Optimization for frameworks

* Mentioned immutable patterns
* Boot time & patterns

### Advices

* Don't memorize the heuristics(because they change all the time)
  * e.g. `try-catch`, FF already shipped the optimization, V8 is working on it
* Use d8, devtools(flame graph), [IRHydra](https://github.com/mraleph/irhydra)
* `node --trace-deopt`
* Benchmark real-world apps
