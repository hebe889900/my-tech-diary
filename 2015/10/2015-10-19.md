## C++

### The mythical performance of `cout`

Source: [Interacting with C](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/io_and_c.html)

First of all, overloading `<<` for different types can happen at compile time via parametric polymorphism, so this won't be an issue.

An important part of the runtime cost comes with synchronization with stdio. Think about this code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>

std::cout << "Hel";
std::printf ("lo, worl");
std::cout << "d!\n";
```

The strings must be printed out in the right order, so `cout`'s buffer must be kept in sync with `printf`'s. In libstdc++ v3.0, C++ I/O library in layered on top of C I/O library by default, so the `iostream`s has very little buffering(most of the buffering is in the underlying C library). This makes the `iostream`s very slow.

If you only uses C++ I/O, use `std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` then gcc will fully buffer `cout` and other streams on their own.

Note: file streams will always be fully buffered, so don't worry about that.

### [Why should I use `<iostream>` instead of the traditional `<cstdio>`?](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/input-output#iostream-vs-stdio)

* The type of object being I/O'd will be known statically by the compiler
* No more `%`, less confusion, less error
* You can overload `<<`/`>>` for user-defined type
* They are inheritable(hmmmm...I don't really think that's a good idea)
