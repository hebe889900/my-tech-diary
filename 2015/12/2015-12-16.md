### [Mixins Are Dead. Long Live Composition](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750#.gb3non5zo)

#### **Utility functions**

Put them in **modules**

#### **Lifecycle Hooks** and **State Providers**

* Why mixins doesn't help
  * They are, in fact, a form of **implicit definition**
  * Conflicts of names
  * They tend to add more state to your component, but you should've strive for less
  * Complicate performance optimizations(how to merge `shouldComponentUpdate`?)
* A higher-order component is just **a function** that takes an existing component and returns another component that wraps it.

  The key is:

  ```javascript
  function connectToStores(Component, stores, getStateFromStores) {
    let StoreConnection = React.createClass({
      // lifecycle hooks can use getStateFromStores
      render() {
          return <Component {...this.props} {...this.state} />;
      }
    });
    return StoreConnection;
  };
  ```
* This way wrapperâ€™s lifecycle hooks work without any special merging behavior

  ```javascript
  ProfilePage = connectToStores(ProfilePage, [UserStore], props => ({
    user: UserStore.get(props.userId)
  });
  ```
* limitations
  * `PureRenderMixin` -> use `PureComponent`, implements `shouldComponentUpdate` (and inheritance)
  * Use callback ref `ref={this.props.someRef}` to notify the higher-order component about attaching and detaching DOM nodes

### [Rebuilding HipChat with React.js](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/02/rebuilding-hipchat-with-react/)

* Rewrite from jQuery to React & Flux
* Why React
  * Component based
  * Declarative
  * Virtual DOM
  * Small, Simple
    * you can memorize the API in a day
    * You can build components with confidence that it'll just work once you've built the first one
  * Unidirectional flow - you know exactly where your data is mutating
  * Testable
