### [C++ Modules in VS 2015 Update 1](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2015/12/03/c-modules-in-vs-2015-update-1.aspx)

* Modules are not gonna do everything the preprocessors can do. The preprocessor's job is to generate pre-tokens for the lexer to consume. Modules are designed for componentization(and it *happens to* speed up compiliation).
* Producer
  * Declare modules with `module ModuleName;`
  * Export interfaces with `export`
  * cl will produce an additional IFC file for the interface, modellded after [Internal Program Representation](http://www.stroustrup.com/gdr-bs-macis09.pdf)
* Consumer
  * `import ModuleName;`, then use the exported inteerface
* Overview
  * The module definition file name doesn't need to match the module name
  * The module definition file ends with `.ixx`, and the IFC file is `ModuleName.ifc`
  * The compiler reads `.ifc`, and the linker consumes `.obj`

* Terrible inflation that comes with `#include`
* `#include` is essentially *textural* copy-and-paste
  * Violates ODR, no consistency, no semantic boundaries
  * Not friendly to developer tools
* Can't verify `extern` declarations in consumers
* Aims
  * Componentization
  * Isolation
  * Build throughput
  * Support for modern semantics-aware developer tools
* Namespace will always be exported, but you can `export` the whole namespace to export every thing defined in it.
* **Isolate modules from macros**
  * Modules won't be affected by macros in the importing TU
  * Macros defined in the module don't leak out
* Modules **won't replace header files**, you can use both.
  * It's best to `#include` first, then `import`
* Module metadata can be used by **packaging systems**
* Provides ownership
