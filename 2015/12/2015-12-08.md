## OMG

When to HIC for a review...Just realized I had a meal with dead-horse, fengmk2 and JacksonTian(my mentor) today....(ﾟДﾟ≡ﾟДﾟ)

### Koa

In Koa, middlewares are decorators. You can easily make a gzip middleware by `yield *next` first, then gzip the body. Then all you need to do is to call this middleware before all other middlewares.

### Spatial Navigation

So there is this thing called *spatial navigation*, something that would happen when you navigate through the UI on your TV with a remote.

A simple design: divide the space of the 2D plane into regions, then use projection to find what's the next target. The components of the UI make up a tree so you can bubble it up. Think about the ray casting in the 3D world...hmmm...

It appears that there's already a W3C specification about this: [Directional focus navigation](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-ui/#nav-dir)

* Use Lua to translate native data to JSON
* Use websocket to push the data to your device
