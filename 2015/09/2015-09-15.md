## Node.js

### Connect

* How to build a Connect middleware that writes something special to your response(e.g. add a monitoring script): Check [this](https://github.com/nateps/connect-gzip/blob/master/lib/gzip.js) out
* Overwrite `res.write` and `res.end` then put this middleware on top

## Gulp

* Many gulp plugins doesn't support streaming because they need to get all file contents before doing their work(e.g. compilation).
* Checkout [gulp-less](https://github.com/plus3network/gulp-less/blob/master/index.js#L24) which uses `through2.obj()`

## Templating

* Handlebars doesn't have recursive lookup. You have to use paths
* Mustache is logic-less. You can't do loops, if-else, etc.
* Handlebars is JS only, Mustache is language-independent
* Jade doesn't support non-HTML and streaming
